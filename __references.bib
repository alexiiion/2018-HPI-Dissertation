abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s). We present metamaterial textures-3D printed surface geometries that can perform a controlled transition between two or more textures. Metamaterial textures are integrated into 3D printed objects and allow designing how the object interacts with the environment and the user's tactile sense. Inspired by foldable paper sheets ("origami") and surface wrinkling, our 3D printed metamaterial textures consist of a grid of cells that fold when compressed by an external global force. Unlike origami, however, metamaterial textures offer full control over the transformation, such as in between states and sequence of actuation. This allows for integrating multiple textures and makes them useful, e.g., for exploring parameters in the rapid prototyping of textures. Metamaterial textures are also robust enough to allow the resulting objects to be grasped, pushed, or stood on. This allows us to make objects, such as a shoe sole that transforms from flat to treaded, a textured door handle that provides tactile feedback to visually impaired users, and a configurable bicycle grip. We present an editor assists users in creating metamaterial textures interactively by arranging cells, applying forces, and previewing their deformation.},

The modules are cubes that can pivot about their edges along the x{\&}{\#}x0302;, y{\&}{\#}x0302;, or z{\&}{\#}x0302; axes to move on a 3-dimensional substrate. This is a different model from prior work, which usually considers modules that slide along their faces. We analyze the pivoting cube model and give sufficient conditions for reconfiguration to be feasible. In particular, we show that if an initial configuration does not contain any of three subconfigurations, which we call rules, then it can reconfigure into a line. We provide provably correct algorithms for reconfiguration for both 2-D and 3-D systems, and we verify our algorithms via simulation on randomly generated 2-D and 3-D configurations.},

abstract = {In the analysis of complex, hierarchical structural meta-materials, it is critical to understand the mechanical behavior at each level of hierarchy in order to understand the bulk material response. We report the fabrication and mechanical deformation of hierarchical hollow tube lattice structures with features ranging from 10 nm to 100 $\mu$m, hereby referred to as nanolattices. Titanium nitride (TiN) nanolattices were fabricated using a combination of two-photon lithography, direct laser writing, and atomic layer deposition. The structure was composed of a series of tessellated regular octahedra attached at their vertices. In situ uniaxial compression experiments performed in combination with finite element analysis on individual unit cells revealed that the TiN was able to withstand tensile stresses of 1.75 GPa under monotonic loading and of up to 1.7 GPa under cyclic loading without failure. During the compression of the unit cell, the beams bifurcated via lateral-torsional buckling, which gave rise to a hyperelastic behavior in the load--displacement data. During the compression of the full nanolattice, the structure collapsed catastrophically at a high strength and modulus that agreed well with classical cellular solid scaling laws given the low relative density of 1.36 {\{}{\%}{\}}. We discuss the compressive behavior and mechanical analysis of the unit cell of these hollow TiN nanolattices in the context of finite element analysis in combination with classical buckling laws, and the behavior of the full structure in the context of classical scaling laws of cellular solids coupled with enhanced nanoscale material properties.},

abstract = {We present a discrete treatment of adapted framed curves, parallel transport, and holonomy, thus establishing the language for a discrete geometric model of thin flexible rods with arbitrary cross section and undeformed configuration. Our approach differs from existing simulation techniques in the graphics and mechanics literature both in the kinematic description—we represent the material frame by its angular deviation from the natural Bishop frame— as well as in the dynamical treatment—we treat the centerline as dynamic and the material frame as quasistatic. Additionally, we describe a manifold projection method for coupling rods to rigid- bodies and simultaneously enforcing rod inextensibility. The use of quasistatics and constraints provides an efficient treatment for stiff twisting and stretching modes; at the same time, we retain the dynamic bending of the centerline and accurately reproduce the coupling between bending and twistingmodes. We validate the discrete rod model via quantitative buckling, stability, and coupled-mode experiments, and via qualitative knot-tying comparisons.},

abstract = {(a) (b) (c) Figure 1: Acoustic Tagging. By optimizing the structure of primitives (a), we control the acoustic response of an object when it is tapped (c) and thereby tag the object acoustically. Given three objects with identical shapes (b), we can use a smartphone to read the acoustic tags in realtime, by recording and analyzing the tapping sound, and thereby identify each object. Abstract Acoustic filters have a wide range of applications, yet customiz-ing them with desired properties is difficult. Motivated by recent progress in additive manufacturing that allows for fast prototyping of complex shapes, we present a computational approach that au-tomates the design of acoustic filters with complex geometries. In our approach, we construct an acoustic filter comprised of a set of parameterized shape primitives, whose transmission matrices can be precomputed. Using an efficient method of simulating the transmis-sion matrix of an assembly built from these underlying primitives, our method is able to optimize both the arrangement and the param-eters of the acoustic shape primitives in order to satisfy target acous-tic properties of the filter. We validate our results against industrial laboratory measurements and high-quality off-line simulations. We demonstrate that our method enables a wide range of applications including muffler design, musical wind instrument prototyping, and encoding imperceptible acoustic information into everyday objects.},

abstract = {Auxetic cellular tubes are emerging as potential candidates for a number of critical devices requiring high resistance to kinking, such as angioplasty stents or annuloplasty rings. This work investigates the collapse under pure bending of auxetic tubes based on inverted hexagonal honeycombs, with the aim to identify design strategies suitable for improving their kinking response. First, the mechanical properties of the structure are determined under small deformation by means of analytical approaches, and used to verify the validity of numerical models. These are then used to simulate the tube collapse under pure bending, and identify the influence of the geometric parameters defining the structure on the phenomenon. The study indicates that the adoption of auxetic tubular structures can contribute to improving considerably the resistance to kinking, suggesting the parameters to be controlled in the design of critical applications.},

Physical curves have several interesting characteristics from the perspective of interaction design: they have a variety of inherent affordances; they can easily represent abstract data; and they can act as constraints, boundaries, or borderlines. By utilizing such aspects of lines and curves, together with the added capability of shape-change, new possibilities for display, interaction, and body constraint are possible. In order to investigate these possibilities we have implemented two actuated curve interfaces at different scales. LineFORM, our implementation, inspired by serpentine robotics, is comprised of a series chain of 1DOF servo motors with integrated sensors for direct manipulation. To motivate this work we present applications such as shape changing cords, mobiles, body constraints, and data manipulation tools.},

As a result, the concave polyhedral surface is discovered, which is composed of a repetition of a fundamental region, which is further composed of four congruent parallelograms.

However, certain materials exhibit “auxetic” properties; that is, they have a negative Poisson's ratio. Thus auxetic and non-auxetic materials exhibit different deformation mechanisms. A specific microscopic structure in the auxetic materials is important for maintaining a negative Poisson's ratio. Based on their distinct nature auxetic materials execute certain unique properties in contrast to other materials, which are reviewed in this paper. Thus auxetic materials have important applications in the biomedical field which are also a part of this review article. Many auxetic materials have been discovered, fabricated, and synthesized which differ on the basis of structure, scale and deformation mechanism. The different types of auxetic materials such as auxetic cellular solids, microscopic auxetic polymers, molecular auxetic materials, and auxetic composites have been reviewed comprehensively in this paper. Modeling of auxetic structures is of considerable importance and needs appropriate stress strain configurations; thus different aspects of auxetic modeling have also been reviewed. Packing parameters and relative densities are of prime importance in this regard. This review would thus help the researchers in determining and deciding the various aspects of auxetic nature for their products.},

We cast computational balloon design as an inverse problem: given a target shape, we compute an optimal balloon that, when inflated, approximates the target as closely as possible. To solve this problem numerically, we propose a novel physics-driven shape optimization method, which combines physical simulation of inflatable elastic mem- branes with a dedicated constrained optimization algorithm. We validate our approach by fabricating balloons designed with our method and comparing their inflated shapes to the results predicted by simulation. An extensive set of manufactured sample balloons demonstrates the shape diversity that can be achieved by our method.},

abstract = {Soft robots possess many attributes that are difficult, if not impossible, to achieve with conventional robots composed of rigid materials. Yet, despite recent advances, soft robots must still be tethered to hard robotic control systems and power sources. New strategies for creating completely soft robots, including soft analogues of these crucial components, are needed to realize their full potential. Here we report the untethered operation of a robot composed solely of soft materials. The robot is controlled with microfluidic logic11 that autonomously regulates fluid flow and, hence, catalytic decomposition of an on-board monopropellant fuel supply. Gas generated from the fuel decomposition inflates fluidic networks downstream of the reaction sites, resulting in actuation. The body and microfluidic logic of the robot are fabricated using moulding and soft lithography, respectively, and the pneumatic actuator networks, on-board fuel reservoirs and catalytic reaction chambers needed for movement are patterned within the body via a multi-material, embedded 3D printing technique. The fluidic and elastomeric architectures required for function span several orders of magnitude from the microscale to the macroscale. Our integrated design and rapid fabrication approach enables the programmable assembly of multiple materials within this architecture, laying the foundation for completely soft, autonomous robots.},

Given the shape of the model's rotational symmetry axis under bending, we use a data-driven method to compute a non-uniformly hollowed shape to realize the desired deformation behavior. The model is fabricated by 3D printing using a single material. (Left) Original pose; (Middle and Right) Two bending behaviors. Abstract We present a method to design the deformation behavior of 3D printed models by an interactive tool, where the variation of bending elasticity at different regions of a model is realized by a change in shell thickness. Given a soft material to be used in 3D printing, we propose an experimental setup to acquire the bending behavior of this material on tubes with different diameters and thicknesses. The relationship between shell thickness and bending elasticity is stored in an echo state network using the acquired dataset. With the help of the network, an interactive design tool is developed to generate non-uniformly hollowed models to achieve desired bending behaviors. The effectiveness of this method is verified on models fabricated by different 3D printers by studying whether their physical deformation can match the designed target shape.},

abstract = {This paper describes a method to design the periodic microstructure of a material to obtain prescribed constitutive properties. The microstructure is modelled as a truss or thin frame structure in 2 and 3 dimensions. The problem of finding the simplest possible microstructure with the prescribed elastic properties can be called an inverse homogenization problem, and is formulated as an optimization problem of finding a microstructure with the lowest possible weight which fulfils the specified behavioral requirements. A full ground structure known from topology optimization of trusses is used as starting guess for the optimization algorithm. This implies that the optimal microstructure of a base cell is found from a truss or frame structure with 120 possible members in the 2-dimensional case and 2016 possible members in the 3-dimensional case. The material parameters are found by a numerical homogenization method, using Finite-Elements to model the representative base cell, and the optimization problem is solved by an optimality criteria method. Numerical examples in two and three dimensions show that it is possible to design materials with many different properties using base cells modelled as truss or frame works. Hereunder is shown that it is possible to tailor extreme materials, such as isotropic materials with Poisson's ratio close to - 1, 0 and 0.5, by the proposed method. Some of the proposed materials have been tested as macro models which demonstrate the expected behaviour. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {Origami has the potential to impact numerous areas of design and manufacturing. Modeling and analysis of origami structures allow for the understanding of their behavior and the development of computational tools for their design. Most available origami models are limited to the idealization of folds as creases of zeroth-order geometric continuity, which is not proper for origami structures having non-negligible fold thickness or with maximum curvature at the folds restricted by material limitations. Structural analysis of origami sheets having creased folds requires further idealizations of the fold mechanical response such as the representation of the folds as torsional springs. In view of this, a novel model analogous to that for rigid origami is presented in this work for origami structures having folds of non-zero surface area that exhibit higher-order geometric continuity (termed smooth folds). This origami model allows for a proper structural analysis of origami sheets using plate or shell representations for the folds. The shape formulation of the smooth folds and the kinematic constraints on their associated shape variables are presented. Modeling of origami structures with smooth folds exhibiting elastic behavior is performed by determining the configuration of the structure that minimizes its total potential energy subject to the derived kinematic constraints. The presented results show that the structural response determined using the proposed model is in good agreement with both experiments and higher-fidelity finite element analyses.},

abstract = {We present the Robotic Modeling Assistant (RoMA), an interactive fabrication system providing a fast, precise, hands-on and in-situ modeling experience. As a designer creates a new model using RoMA AR CAD editor, features are constructed concurrently by a 3D printing robotic arm sharing the same design volume. The partially printed physical model then serves as a tangible reference for the designer as she adds new elements to her design. RoMA's proxemics-inspired handshake mechanism between the designer and the 3D printing robotic arm allows the designer to quickly interrupt printing to access a printed area or to indicate that the robot can take full control of the model to finish printing. RoMA lets users integrate real-world constraints into a design rapidly, allowing them to create well-proportioned tangible artifacts or to extend existing objects. We conclude by presenting the strengths and limitations of our current design.},

abstract = {Compliant mechanisms are able to transfer motion, force, and energy using a monolithic structure without discrete hinge elements. The geometric design freedoms and multi-material capability offered by the PolyJet 3D printing process enables the fabrication of compliant mechanisms with optimized topology. The inclusion of multiple materials in the topology optimization process has the potential to eliminate the narrow, weak, hinge-like sections that are often present in single-material compliant mechanisms. In this paper, the authors propose a design and fabrication process for the realization of 3-phase, multiple-material compliant mechanisms. The process is tested on a 2D compliant force inverter. Experimental and theoretical performance of the resulting 3-phase inverter is compared against a standard 2-phase design.},

Since these meander patterns are obtained by remeshing processes, we can control the local properties of the pattern with intensity of images to obtain different stiffness values in different regions.

We seek to make physical user interface (PHUI) design more like graphical user interface (GUI) design by using a dragand drop interface to place widgets, allowing widgets to be repositioned and by hiding implementation details. PHUIs are interfaces built from tangible widgets arranged on the surfaces of physical objects. PHUI layout will become more important as we move from rectangular screens to purposebuilt interactive devices. Approaches to PHUI layout based on sculpture make it difficult to reposition widgets, and software approaches do not involve placing widgets on the device exterior. We created PHUI-kit, a software approach to PHUI layout on 3D printed enclosures, which has a drag-and-drop interface, supports repositioning of widgets, and hides implementation details. We describe algorithms for placing widgets on curved surfaces, modifying the enclosure geometry, and routing wiring inside the enclosure. The tool is easy to use and supports a wide range of design possibilities.},

abstract = {We introduce an algorithm and representation for fabricating 3D shape abstractions using mutually intersecting planar cut-outs. The planes have prefabricated slits at their intersections and are assembled by sliding them together. Often such abstractions are used as a sculptural art form or in architecture and are colloquially called ‘cardboard sculptures'. Based on an analysis of construction rules, we propose an extended binary space partitioning tree as an efficient representation of such cardboard models which allows us to quickly evaluate the feasibility of newly added planar elements. The complexity of insertion order quickly increases with the number of planar elements and manual analysis becomes intractable. We provide tools for generating cardboard sculptures with guaranteed constructibility. In combination with a simple optimization and sampling strategy for new elements, planar shape abstraction models can be designed by iteratively adding elements. As an output, we obtain a fabrication plan that can be printed or sent to a laser cutter. We demonstrate the complete process by designing and fabricating cardboard models of various well-known 3D shapes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {The mechanical properties of ordinary materials degrade substantially with reduced density because their structural elements bend under applied load. We report a class of microarchitected materials that maintain a nearly constant stiffness per unit mass density, even at ultralow density. This performance derives from a network of nearly isotropic microscale unit cells with high structural connectivity and nanoscale features, whose structural members are designed to carry loads in tension or compression. Production of these microlattices, with polymers, metals, or ceramics as constituent materials, is made possible by projection microstereolithography (an additive micromanufacturing technique) combined with nanoscale coating and postprocessing. We found that these materials exhibit ultrastiff properties across more than three orders of magnitude in density, regardless of the constituent material.},

But ever since the dawn of synthetic organic chemistry in the 1820s, the process has required slow, painstaking effort. Now, however, researchers led by Martin Burke, a chemist at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, have developed a novel machine that may change all that. The machine automatically synthesizes new small organic molecules by welding together premade building blocks that can be put together in any configuration. Two hundred such building blocks already exist. And thousands of other similar molecules can also be used in the process. As a result, the machine has the ability to make billions of different small organic compounds that can then be tested as new drugs or for other uses. If widely adopted, the synthesis machine could revolutionize organic chemistry, turning it from a slow, painstaking process to a made-for-order business.},

(1-4) Deformable packings created in a semi-automatic way. (5) A manually-designed branching structure. Abstract We present a computational tool for designing ornamental curve networks—structurally-sound physical surfaces with user-controlled aesthetics. In contrast to approaches that leverage tex-ture synthesis for creating decorative surface patterns, our method relies on user-defined spline curves as central design primitives. More specifically, we build on the physically-inspired metaphor of an embedded elastic curve that can move on a smooth surface, de-form, and connect with other curves. We formalize this idea as a globally coupled energy-minimization problem, discretized with piece-wise linear curves that are optimized in the parametric space of a smooth surface. Building on this technical core, we propose a set of interactive design and editing tools that we demonstrate on manually-created layouts and semi-automated deformable pack-ings. In order to prevent excessive compliance, we furthermore propose a structural analysis tool that uses eigenanalysis to identify potentially large deformations between geodesically-close curves and guide the user in strengthening the corresponding regions. We used our approach to create a variety of designs in simulation, vali-dated with a set of 3D-printed physical prototypes.},

By varying the number, size, and locations of these inclusions as well as their material, a broad range of mechanical properties can be achieved. The technical core of our approach is formed by an optimization algorithm that, combining a simulation model based on extended finite elements (XFEM) and sensitivity analysis, computes inclusion distributions that lead to desired stiffness properties on the macroscopic level. We explore the design space of MetaSilicone on an extensive set of simulation experiments involving materials with optimized uni- and bi-directional stiffness, spatially-graded properties, as well as multi-material composites. We present validation through standard measurements on physical prototypes, which we fabricate on a modified filament-based 3D printer, thus combining the advantages of digital fabrication with the mechanical performance of silicone elastomers.},

Just as digital information and toolsets have transformed the practice of design, manufacturing and architecture, they will soon bring light to new possibilities of construction and assembly. Digital information is at the brink of a rediscovery, one that will propagate itself within our physical materials and be realized as an inherent phenomenon within the perceived analog world.},

abstract = {Ceramics have some of the highest strength- and stiffness-to-weight ratios of any material but are suboptimal for use as structural materials because of their brittleness and sensitivity to flaws. We demonstrate the creation of structural metamaterials composed of nanoscale ceramics that are simultaneously ultralight, strong, and energy-absorbing and can recover their original shape after compressions in excess of 50{\%} strain. Hollow-tube alumina nanolattices were fabricated using two-photon lithography, atomic layer deposition, and oxygen plasma etching. Structures were made with wall thicknesses of 5 to 60 nanometers and densities of 6.3 to 258 kilograms per cubic meter. Compression experiments revealed that optimizing the wall thickness-to-radius ratio of the tubes can suppress brittle fracture in the constituent solid in favor of elastic shell buckling, resulting in ductile-like deformation and recoverability.},

abstract = {We present an interactive design system that allows non-expert users to create animated mechanical characters. Given an articulated character as input, the user iteratively creates an animation by sketching motion curves indicating how different parts of the character should move. For each motion curve, our framework creates an optimized mechanism that reproduces it as closely as possible. The resulting mechanisms are attached to the character and then connected to each other using gear trains, which are created in a semi-automated fashion. The mechanical assemblies generated with our system can be driven with a single input driver, such as a hand-operated crank or an electric motor, and they can be fabricated using rapid prototyping devices. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach by designing a wide range of mechanical characters, several of which we manufactured using 3D printing. While our pipeline is designed for characters driven by planar mechanisms, significant parts of it extend directly to non-planar mechanisms, allowing us to create characters with compelling 3D motions.},

abstract = {A key requirement in 3D fabrication is to generate objects with individual exterior shapes and their interior being optimized to application-specific force constraints and low material consumption. Accomplishing this task is challenging on desktop computers, due to the extreme model resolutions that are required to accurately predict the physical shape properties, requiring memory and computational capacities going beyond what is currently available. Moreover, fabrication-specific constraints need to be considered to enable printability. To address these challenges, we present a scalable system for generating 3D objects using topology optimization, which allows to efficiently evolve the topology of high-resolution solids towards printable and light-weight-high-resistance structures. To achieve this, the system is equipped with a high-performance GPU solver which can efficiently handle models comprising several millions of elements. A minimum thickness constraint is built into the optimization process to automatically enforce printability of the resulting shapes. We further shed light on the question how to incorporate geometric shape constraints, such as symmetry and pattern repetition, in the optimization process. We analyze the performance of the system and demonstrate its potential by a variety of different shapes such as interior structures within closed surfaces, exposed support structures, and surface models.},

abstract = {Auxetic materials expand in an unusual way: perpendicular to the direction in which they are stretched. Lipton et al. engineered a type of auxetic material that also has handedness. When this material is sheared, it twists either to the right or the left. By tiling the underlying patterns onto spheres and cylinders, rigid or compliant structures can be made. Linear and 4-degree-of-freedom actuators can thus be made from hollow tubes, which could be valuable for a variety of engineering and medical applications.Science, this issue p. 632In nature, repeated base units produce handed structures that selectively bond to make rigid or compliant materials. Auxetic tilings are scale-independent frameworks made from repeated unit cells that expand under tension. We discovered how to produce handedness in auxetic unit cells that shear as they expand by changing the symmetries and alignments of auxetic tilings. Using the symmetry and alignment rules that we developed, we made handed shearing auxetics that tile planes, cylinders, and spheres. By compositing the handed shearing auxetics in a manner inspired by keratin and collagen, we produce both compliant structures that expand while twisting and deployable structures that can rigidly lock. This work opens up new possibilities in designing chemical frameworks, medical devices like stents, robotic systems, and deployable engineering structures.},

Through studying the dynamics of wave propagation in a chain composed of finite metastable modules, we provide experimental and analytical results on nonreciprocal wave propagation and unveil the underlying mechanisms that facilitate such unidirectional energy transmission. In addition, we demonstrate that via transitioning among the numerous metastable states, the proposed metastructure is endowed with a large number of bandgap reconfiguration possibilities. As a result, we illustrate that unprecedented adaptable nonreciprocal wave propagation can be realized using the metastable modular metastructure. Overall, this research elucidates the rich dynamics attainable through the combinations of periodicity, nonlinearity, spatial asymmetry, and metastability and creates a class of adaptive structural and material systems capable of realizing tunable bandgaps and nonreciprocal wave transmissions.},

However, cloaking in the seemingly simple case of three-dimensional solid mechanics is more demanding. Here, inspired by invisible core-shell nanoparticles in optics, we design an approximate elasto-mechanical core-shell 'unfeelability' cloak based on pentamode metamaterials. The resulting three-dimensional polymer microstructures with macroscopic overall volume are fabricated by rapid dip-in direct laser writing optical lithography. We quasi-statically deform cloak and control samples in the linear regime and map the displacement fields by autocorrelation-based analysis of recorded movies. The measured and the calculated displacement fields show very good cloaking performance. This means that one can elastically hide objects along these lines.},

Users interact by drafting directly on the workpiece using a hand-held laser pointer. The system tracks the pointer, beautifies its path, and implements its effect by cutting the workpiece using a fast high-powered laser cutter. Constructable achieves precision through tool-specific constraints, user-defined sketch lines, and by using the laser cutter itself for all visual feedback, rather than using a screen or projection.

abstract = {This paper describes a group of auxetic-inspired material structures that can transform into various shapes upon compression. We developed four cellular-based material structure units composed of rigid plates and elastic/rotary hinges. Different compositions of these units lead to a variety of tunable shape-changing possibilities, such as uniform scaling, shearing, bending and rotating. By tessellating those transformations together, we can create various higher level transformations for product design. In the paper, we first give a geometrical and numerical description of the units' configuration and their degrees of freedom. An interactive simulation tool is developed for users to input designed structures and preview the transformation. Finally we present three application prototypes that utilize our proposed structures.},

Experimental results were compared to a proposed model for predicting the bulk compression modulus of the composites. Additionally, preliminary studies indicate that the composites exhibit self-healing properties, in which heating between loading cycles can mend wax that has been plastically deformed, for example, by cracking or delaminating from the foam.{\textless}inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href=""{\textgreater}mame201400017-gra-0001{\textless}/inline-graphic},

When a soft cavity is squeezed, air pulses travel along a flexible pipe and into a uniquely designed corrugated tube that shapes the airflow into predictable sound signatures. A microphone captures and identifies these air pulses enabling interactivity. We describe the underlying acoustic theory used to inform our design, an informal examination of the effect of different 3D-printed corrugations on air signatures, and our resulting SqueezaPulse implementation. To demonstrate and evaluate the potential of SqueezaPulse, we present four prototype applications and a small, lab-based user study (N=9). Our evaluations show that our approach is accurate across users and robust to external noise. We conclude with a discussion of limitations and future work. {\textcopyright} 2017 ACM.},

abstract = {We introduce the foldabilization problem for space-saving furniture design. Namely, given a 3D object representing a piece of furniture, our goal is to apply a minimum amount of modification to the object so that it can be folded to save space - the object is thus foldabilized. We focus on one instance of the problem where folding is with respect to a prescribed folding direction and allowed object modifications include hinge insertion and part shrinking. We develop an automatic algorithm for foldabilization by formulating and solving a nested optimization problem operating at two granularity levels of the input shape. Specifically, the input shape is first partitioned into a set of integral folding units. For each unit, we construct a graph which encodes conflict relations, e.g., collisions, between foldings implied by various patch foldabilizations within the unit. Finding a minimum-cost foldabilization with a conflictfree folding is an instance of the maximum-weight independent set problem. In the outer loop of the optimization, we process the folding units in an optimized ordering where the units are sorted based on estimated foldabilization costs. We show numerous foldabilization results computed at interactive speed and 3D-print physical prototypes of these results to demonstrate manufacturability.},

@article{Saxena2005,
abstract = {In this paper is described a procedure to synthesize the optimal topology, shape, and size of compliant continua for a given nonlinear output path. The path is prescribed using a finite number of distinct precision points much in accordance with the synthesis for path generation in traditional kinematics. Geometrically nonlinear analysis is employed to model large displacements of the constituent members. It is also essential to employ nonlinear analysis to allow the output port to negotiate the prescribed path accurately. The topology synthesis problem is addressed in its original binary form in that the corresponding design variables are only allowed to assume values of “0” for no material and “1” for the material present at a site in the design region. Shape and size design variables are modeled using continuous functions. Owing to the discrete nature of topology design variables, since gradient based optimization methods cannot be employed, a genetic algorithm is used that utilizes only the objective values to approach an optimum solution. A notable advantage of a genetic algorithm over its gradient based counterparts is the implicit circumvention of nonconvergence in the large displacement analysis, which is another reason why a genetic algorithm is chosen for optimization. The least squared objective is used to compare the design and desired output responses. To allow a user to specify preference for a precision point, individual multiple least squared objectives, same in number as the precision points are used. The multiple objectives are solved using Nondominated Sorting in Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) to yield a set of pareto optimal solutions. Thus, multiple solutions for compliant mechanisms can be obtained such that a mechanism can traverse one or some precision points among those specified more precisely. To traverse the entire path, a solution that minimizes the sum of individual least square objectives may be chosen. Synthesis examples are presented to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method that is capable of generating a solution that can be manufactured as is without requiring any interpretation.},

abstract = {Folding is ubiquitous in nature with examples ranging from the formation of cellular components to winged insects. It finds technological applications including packaging of solar cells and space structures, deployable biomedical devices, and self-assembling robots and airbags. Here we demonstrate sequential self-folding structures realized by thermal activation of spatially-variable patterns that are 3D printed with digital shape memory polymers, which are digital materials with different shape memory behaviors. The time-dependent behavior of each polymer allows the temporal sequencing of activation when the structure is subjected to a uniform temperature. This is demonstrated via a series of 3D printed structures that respond rapidly to a thermal stimulus, and self-fold to specified shapes in controlled shape changing sequences. Measurements of the spatial and temporal nature of self-folding structures are in good agreement with the companion finite element simulations. A simplified reduced-order model is also developed to rapidly and accurately describe the self-folding physics. An important aspect of self-folding is the management of self-collisions, where different portions of the folding structure contact and then block further folding. A metric is developed to predict collisions and is used together with the reduced-order model to design self-folding structures that lock themselves into stable desired configurations.},

abstract = {Materials and structures with negative Poisson's ratio exhibit a counter-intuitive behaviour. Under uniaxial compression (tension), these materials and structures contract (expand) transversely. The materials and structures that possess this feature are also termed as 'auxetics'. Many desirable properties resulting from this uncommon behaviour are reported. These superior properties offer auxetics broad potential applications in the fields of smart filters, sensors, medical devices and protective equipment. However, there are still challenging problems which impede a wider application of auxetic materials. This review paper mainly focuses on the relationships among structures, materials, properties and applications of auxetic metamaterials and structures. The previous works of auxetics are extensively reviewed, including different auxetic cellular models, naturally observed auxetic behaviour, different desirable properties of auxetics, and potential applications. In particular, metallic auxetic materials and a methodology for generating 3D metallic auxetic materials are reviewed in details. Although most of the literature mentions that auxetic materials possess superior properties, very few types of auxetic materials have been fabricated and implemented for practical applications. Here, the challenges and future work on the topic of auxetics are also presented to inspire prospective research work. This review article covers the most recent progress of auxetic metamaterials and auxetic structures. More importantly, several drawbacks of auxetics are also presented to caution researchers in the future study.},

An orthogonal array, main effect, the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) are employed to investigate the process parameters in order to achieve optimum elastic performance of a compliant ABS prototype so as to get maximum throwing distance from the prototype. Through this study, not only can the optimal process parameters for FDM process be obtained, but also the main process parameters that affect the performance of the prototype can be found. Experiments were carried out to confirm the effectiveness of this approach. From the results, it is found that FDM parameters, i.e. layer thickness, raster angle and air gap significantly affect the elastic performance of the compliant ABS prototype. The optimum levels of parameters at different angle of displacement are also presented. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). In recent years, many materials mass-produced in industrialized societies are flat, thin, and with many squares. Within such a social context, customized machines like conventional shape-changing interfaces will take much time and labor to become popular. We aimed to overcome the weaknesses of such conventional shape-changing interfaces and make them easy to manufacture and apply even for PC users. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to revise the manufacturing method. If it is possible to prepare a flat plate which is inexpensive, available and easily processed, it becomes possible to disseminate the shape changing interface at low cost. In recent times, processing machines such as laser cutters have become more widely available so it is becoming increasingly possible to reduce the cost of estuaries. Therefore, we redesigned the manufacturing method for shape changing interfaces using flat plate which, with our method, can be produced at lower cost and with less labor. Many objects in the world are made by processing flat plates, so the processing of flat plates is an important factor. By using the manufacturing method of shape changing interfaces proposed by us, it becomes possible to embed them naturally in interiors such as furniture made from flat plate.},

abstract = {Personal fabrication is currently a one-way process: once an object has been fabricated with a 3D printer, it cannot be changed anymore. Any change requires printing a new version from scratch. The problem is that this approach ignores the nature of design iteration, i.e. that in subsequent iterations large parts of an object stay the same and only small parts change. This makes fabricating from scratch feel unnecessary and wasteful. In this paper, we propose a different approach: instead of re-printing the entire object from scratch, we suggest patching the existing object to reflect the next design iteration. We built a system on top of a 3D printer that accomplishes this: Users mount the existing object into the 3D printer, then load both the original and the modified 3D model into our software, which in turn calculates how to patch the object. After identifying which parts to remove and what to add, our system locates the existing object in the printer using the system?s built-in 3D scanner. After calibrating the orientation, a mill first removes the outdated geometry, then a print head prints the new geometry in place. Since only a fraction of the entire object is refabricated, our approach reduces material consumption and plastic waste (for our example objects by 82{\%} and 93{\%} respectively).},

abstract = {Mechanical metamaterials are engineered materials that gain their remarkable mechanical properties, such as negative Poisson's ratios, negative compressibility, phononic bandgaps, and topological phonon modes, from their structure rather than composition. Here we propose a new design principle, based on a uniform soft deformation of the whole structure, to allow metamaterials to be immediately and reversibly transformed between states with contrasting mechanical and acoustic properties. These properties are protected by the topological structure of the phonon band of the whole structure and are thus highly robust against disorder and noise. We discuss the general classification of all structures that exhibit such soft deformations, and provide specific examples to demonstrate how to utilize soft deformations to transform a system between different regimes such that remarkable changes in their properties, including edge stiffness and speed of sound, can be achieved.},

abstract = {Traditional flow volumes construct an explicit geometrical or parametrical representation from the vector field. The geometry is updated interactively and then rendered using an unstructured volume rendering technique. Unless a detailed refinement of the flow volume is specified for the interior, information inside the underlying flow volume is lost in the linear interpolation. These disadvantages can be avoided and/or alleviated using an implicit flow model. An implicit flow is a scalar field constructed such that any point in the field is associated with a termination surface using an advection operator on the flow. We present two techniques, a slice-based three-dimensional texture mapping and an interval volume segmentation coupled with a tetrahedron projection-based renderer, to render implicit stream flows. In the first method, the implicit flow representation is loaded as a 3D texture and manipulated using a dynamic texture operation that allows the flow to be investigated interactively. In our second method, a geometric flow volume is extracted from the implicit flow using a high dimensional isocontouring or interval volume routine. This provides a very detailed flow volume or set of flow volumes that can easily change topology, while retaining accurate characteristics within the flow volume. The advantages and disadvantages of these two techniques are compared with traditional explicit flow volumes.},

A simple rule based on a rotate-and-mirror procedure is introduced to achieve multi-level hierarchies. These new hierarchical structures have remarkably few degrees of freedom compared to existing designs by other methods. More importantly, these structures exhibit synchronized motions during opening or closure, resulting in uniform and easily-controllable deformations. Furthermore, a simple analytical formula is found which can be used to avoid collision of units of the structure during the closing process. The novel design concept is verified by mathematical analyses, computational simulations and physical experiments.},

We present an algorithm to generate designs for spinning objects by optimizing rotational dynamics properties. As input, the user provides a solid 3D model and a desired axis of rotation. Our approach then modifies the mass distribution such that the principal directions of the moment of inertia align with the target rotation frame. We augment the model by creating voids inside its volume, with interior fill represented by an adaptive multi-resolution voxelization. The discrete voxel fill values are optimized using a continuous, nonlinear formulation. Further, we optimize for rotational stability by maximizing the dominant principal moment. We extend our technique to incorporate deformation and multiple materials for cases where internal voids alone are insufficient. Our method is well-suited for a variety of 3D printed models, ranging from characters to abstract shapes. We demonstrate tops and yo-yos that spin surprisingly stably despite their asymmetric appearance.},

abstract = {We present a new method for real-time physics-based simulation supporting many different types of hyperelastic materials. Previous methods such as Position Based or Projective Dynamics are fast, but support only limited selection of materials; even classical materials such as the Neo-Hookean elasticity are not supported. Recently, Xu et al. [2015] introduced new "spline-based materials" which can be easily controlled by artists to achieve desired animation effects. Simulation of these types of materials currently relies on Newton's method, which is slow, even with only one iteration per timestep. In this paper, we show that Projective Dynamics can be interpreted as a quasi-Newton method. This insight enables very efficient simulation of a large class of hyperelastic materials, including the Neo-Hookean, spline-based materials, and others. The quasi-Newton interpretation also allows us to leverage ideas from numerical optimization. In particular, we show that our solver can be further accelerated using L-BFGS updates (Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm). Our final method is typically more than 10 times faster than one iteration of Newton's method without compromising quality. In fact, our result is often more accurate than the result obtained with one iteration of Newton's method. Our method is also easier to implement, implying reduced software development costs.},

In contrast, we show that the problem is tractable---indeed, solvable in linear time on a real RAM---for straight-line embeddings of planar 3-connected triangulations, even if the outer face is not a triangle. This result is essentially tight: the prob- lem becomes NP-hard if we consider instead straight-line embeddings of planar 3-connected infinitesimally rigid graphs with unit edge lengths, a natural relaxation of triangulations in this context.},

abstract = {We introduce Plushie, an interactive system that allows nonprofessional users to design their own original plush toys. To design a plush toy, one needs to construct an appropriate two-dimensional (2D) pattern. However, it is difficult for non-professional users to appropriately design a 2D pattern. Some recent systems automatically generate a 2D pattern for a given three-dimensional (3D) model, but constructing a 3D model is itself a challenge. Furthermore, an arbitrary 3D model cannot necessarily be realized as a real plush toy, and the final sewn result can be very different from the original 3D model. We avoid this mismatch by constructing appropriate 2D patterns and applying simple physical simulation to it on the fly during 3D modeling. In this way, the model on the screen is always a good approximation of the final sewn result, which makes the design process much more efficient. We use a sketching interface for 3D modeling and also provide various editing operations tailored for plush toy design. Internally, the system constructs a 2D cloth pattern in such a way that the simulation result matches the user's input stroke. Our goal is to show that relatively simple algorithms can provide fast, satisfactory results to the user whereas the pursuit of optimal layout and simulation accuracy lies outside this paper's scope. We successfully demonstrated that non-professional users could design plush toys or balloon easily using Plushie.},

abstract = {Functionally Graded Rapid Prototyping (FGRP) is a novel design approach and technological framework enabling the controlled spatial variation of material properties through continuous gradients in functional components. Such variations are traditionally achieved as discrete delineations in physical behavior by fabricating multiple parts comprised of different materials, and assembling them only after the fabrication process has been completed. Recent advances in Computational Topology Design (CTD) and Solid Free- Form Fabrication (SFF) are promoting the creation of building components with controlled micro-, and macro-architectural features. The FGRP approach combines a novel software environment with a mechanical output tool designed as a 3-D printer to allow computer control of material distribution within a monolithic structure. Inspired by the integration of material, structure and form found in natural systems, this biologically inspired design approach allows for physical prototyping of graduated properties in product and architectural design scales. FGRP introduces the potential to dynamically mix, grade and vary the ratios of different mate- rials, resulting in continuous gradients, and structurally optimized designs with efficient use of materials, re- ductions in waste and production of highly customizable features. The paper presents the FGRP technology as part of an overall integrated design approach to functionally gradient design fabrication. Two work-in- progress explorations of FGRP implementation are presented: a robotic arm able to 3-D print concrete with controllable density and a 3-D printer for UV-curable polymers exploring variable elasticity. Research meth- ods and processes devised for its development are presented and design applications demonstrated. Current technological limitations and future directions are discussed and their implications reviewed.},

abstract = {We demonstrate a new approach for designing functional mate- rial definitions for multi-material fabrication using our system called Foundry. Foundry provides an interactive and visual process for hierarchically designing spatially-varying material properties (e.g., appearance, mechanical, optical). The result- ing meta-materials exhibit structure at the micro and macro level and can surpass the qualities of traditional composites. The material definitions are created by composing a set of operators into an operator graph. Each operator performs a volume decomposition operation, remaps space, or constructs and assigns a material composition. The operators are imple- mented using a domain-specific language for multi-material fabrication; users can easily extend the library by writing their own operators. Foundry can be used to build operator graphs that describe complex, parameterized, resolution-independent, and reusable material definitions. We also describe how to stage the evaluation of the final material definition which in conjunction with progressive refinement, allows for interac- tive material evaluation even for complex designs. We show sophisticated and functional parts designed with our system.},

abstract = {The classification of materials into insulators and conductors has been shaken up by the discovery of topological insulators that conduct robustly at the edge but not in the bulk. In mechanics, designating a material as insulating or conducting amounts to asking if it is rigid or floppy. Although mechanical structures that display topological floppy modes have been proposed, they are all vulnerable to global collapse. Here, we design and build mechanical metamaterials that are stable and yet capable of harboring protected edge and bulk modes, analogous to those in electronic topological insulators and Weyl semimetals. To do so, we exploit gear assemblies that, unlike point masses connected by springs, incorporate both translational and rotational degrees of freedom. Global structural stability is achieved by eliminating geometrical frustration of collective gear rotations extending through the assembly. The topological robustness of the mechanical modes makes them appealing across scales from engineered macrostructures to networks of toothed microrotors of potential use in micro-machines.},

abstract = {This thesis investigates several aspects of the design of compliant mechanisms and structures. It focuses the structural synthesis as well as the postprocessing of the data obtained by the optimization. Finally, the adaptive care seat concept demonstrates the capability of the synthesis procedure. A method is introduced to solve compliant mechanism and structure problems that combines evolutionary optimization techniques with the ground structure approach whereas the use of graph theory and a complex-shaped, two-dimensional beam element can increase both numerical efficiency and solution space. The beam element is curved and of variable thickness so that a localized compliant region can be placed within one beam element. The ground structure topology is represented by a mathematical graph whose edges and vertices fall together with the beams and their nodes, respectively. All genetic operators, i.e., mutation and crossover, directly apply on the graph representation (vertices and edges). This implies a set of modified and new genetic operators, which are also developed within this work. The graph-based representation allows the optimization of topology, geometry, and sizing of the beam structures at the same time. Besides this, it can handle individuals of different sizes. As a further feature, the graph-based optimization is able to find solutions for highly-constrained and discrete optimization problems such as for multi-material optimization. The inverter and the gripper optimization sample problems serve to demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of the method. Compliant mechanisms and structures often undergo large displacement, in order to provide their functionality. Therefore, geometrical nonlinear analysis is required. The presented optimization provides both options; geometrical linear as well as nonlinear analysis. Sample large displacement grippers are illustrating the difference of the linear and nonlinear analysis. The graph-based design environment helps setting up new optimizations, visualizing and analyzing the optimized results and allow a fast aftertreatment of the structures obtained by the optimization. The aftertreatment or the so-called final design interpretation step is necessary, since the outcomes of the optimization are encoded according to the graph representation and not directly real-world models. The final design interpretation maps the encoded data into CAD(Computer Aided Design) models. An adaptive car seat concept is presented as a new, possible application of large scale, shape morphing, compliant structure. The adaptive car seat consists of compliant rib-like structures, which are kept by two columns in position. The compliant rib-like structure are designed to adapt themselves to the driver by embracing the back, when he leans into the seat and applying an additional actuation force. The whole development procedure is presented starting from the design domain parametrization and the fitness formulation up to the postprocessing of the optimization result. Finally, the real-world prototype, which integrates a pneumatic actuation system, validates the structural behavior predicted by the graph-based optimization. The adaptive car seat concept serves as an example of simultaneously increasing the functionalities and decreasing the complexity of a construction (number of parts).},

However, the relation between the printed structure and the parameters causing the printing error is unclear. In this paper, we focus on the height position of the extruder and the amount of extruded material, and explore the combination of these parameters to enhance the capability of FDM. By extending an equation that calculates the amount of material from the layer height, we investigate the behavior and structure of material extruded from various height positions.

We describe these structural features and demonstrate examples with new inherent expressions for FDM.},

Possible applications include materials with unusual properties such as negative Poisson's ratio, phononic and photonic switches and colorful and reconfigurable displays. Although shape plays an important role in the design and performance of periodic materials, so far only the non-linear response of structures with circular and elliptical pores has been investigated and the effect of the pore shape on the structural response has not yet been explored. Here, we numerically explore the effect of pore shape on the non-linear response of a square array of pores in an elastomeric matrix.

abstract = {Objects with various types of mechanical joints are among the most commonly built. Joints implement a vocabulary of simple constrained motions (kinematic pairs) that can be used to build more complex behaviors. Defining physically correct joint geometry is crucial both for realistic appearance of models during motion, as these are typically the only parts of geometry that stay in contact, and for fabrication. Direct design of joint geometry often requires more effort than the design of the rest of the object geometry, as it requires design of components that stay in precise contact, are aligned with other parts, and allow the desired range of motion. We present an interactive system for creating physically realizable joints with user-controlled appearance. Our system minimizes or, in most cases, completely eliminates the need for the user to manipulate low-level geometry of joints. This is achieved by automatically inferring a small number of plausible combinations of joint dimensions, placement and orientation from part geometry, with the user making the final high-level selection based on object semantic. Through user studies, we demonstrate that functional results with a satisfying appearance can be obtained quickly by users with minimal modeling experience, offering a significant improvement in the time required for joint construction, compared to standard modeling approaches.},

abstract = {A topology optimization technique for systematically designing contact-aided compliant mechanisms (CCM) is presented in this paper. A CCM is a single piece elastic body that uses intermittent contacts in addition to elastic deformation to transmit force and motion. Contact interactions give rise to interesting nonlinear and nonsmooth behaviors even under the small deflection assumption made in this work. The difficulties associated with the nondifferentiability inherent in the CCM systematic synthesis problem are circumvented by using a regularized contact model. This model uses a smooth approximation of the unilateral displacement constraints that are used to model contact interactions. The use of a regularized contact model in the underlying state problem makes it possible to use efficient smooth optimization algorithms for the systematic synthesis of CCMs. The formulation of the design problem for CCMs, sensitivity analysis, and solution methodology are presented. The paper includes CCM designs that exhibit nonsmooth motion and force transmission characteristics, which are not possible or practical with compliant mechanisms that do not use intermittent contact interactions. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Architectured materials with rationally designed geometries could be used to create mechanical metamaterials with unprecedented or rare properties and functionalities. Here, we introduce "shape-matching" metamaterials where the geometry of cellular structures comprising auxetic and conventional unit cells is designed so as to achieve a pre-defined shape upon deformation. We used computational models to forward-map the space of planar shapes to the space of geometrical designs. The validity of the underlying computational models was first demonstrated by comparing their predictions with experimental observations on specimens fabricated with indirect additive manufacturing. The forward-maps were then used to devise the geometry of cellular structures that approximate the arbitrary shapes described by random Fourier's series. Finally, we show that the presented metamaterials could match the contours of three real objects including a scapula model, a pumpkin, and a Delft Blue pottery piece.

abstract = {We report a new class of tunable and switchable acoustic metamaterials comprising resonating units dispersed into an elastic matrix. Each resonator consists of a metallic core connected to the elastomeric matrix through elastic beams, whose buckling is intentionally exploited as a novel and effective approach to control the propagation of elastic waves.We first use numerical analysis to showthe evolution of the locally resonant band gap, fully accounting for the effect of nonlinear pre-deformation. Then, we experimentally measure the transmission of vibrations as a function of the applied loading in a finite-size sample and find excellent agreement with our numerical predictions. The proposed concept expands the ability of existing acoustic metamaterials by enabling tunability over a wide range of frequencies. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in our system the deformation can be exploited to turn on or off the band gap, opening avenues for the design of adaptive switches.},

We present Steel-Sense, an approach to joining these two families of elements to create a new type of HCI design primitive. We leverage recent developments in 3D printing to embed sensing in metal structures that are otherwise difficult to equip with sensors, and present four design principles, implementing (1) an electronic switch integrated within a ball bearing; (2) a voltage divider within a gear; (3) a variable capacitor embedded in a hinge; and (4) a pressure sensor within a screw. Each design demonstrates a different sensing principle, and signals its performance through (1) movement; (2) position; (3) angle (4) or stress. We mirror our elements physical performance in a virtual environment, evaluate our designs electronically and structurally, and discuss future work and implications for HCI research.},

abstract = {We present a new approach to rapid prototyping of functional objects, such as the body of a head-mounted display. The key idea is to save 3D printing time by automatically substituting sub-volumes with standard building blocks'in our case Lego bricks. When making the body for a head-mounted display, for example, getting the optical path right is paramount. Users thus mark the lens mounts as "high-resolution" to indicate that these should later be 3D printed. faBrickator then 3D prints these parts. It also generates instructions that show users how to create everything else from Lego bricks. If users iterate on the design later, faBrickator offers even greater benefit as it allows re-printing only the elements that changed. We validated our system at the example of three 3D models of functional objects. On average, our system fabricates objects 2.44 times faster than traditional 3D printing while requiring only 14 minutes of manual assembly.},

Three stable equilibrium positions are within the range of the linear motion of the mechanism. The proposed mechanism has no movable joints and gains its mobility from the deflection of flexible members. The tristability of the mechanism originates from the different actuation loads of the two bistable mechanisms. Finite element analyses are used to characterize the tristable behavior of the mechanism under static loading. An optimal design formulation is proposed to find the geometry parameters of the mechanism. Prototypes of the mechanism are fabricated by a simple electroforming process. The characteristics of the mechanism are verified by experiments. The force versus displacement curve of the mechanism exhibits the tristable behavior within a displacement range of 260 ??m. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 ACM. Low-cost fabrication machines (e.g., 3D printers) offer the promise of creating custom-designed objects by a range of users. To maximize performance, generative design methods such as topology optimization can automatically optimize properties of a design based on high-level specifications. Though promising, such methods require people to map their design ideas-often unintuitively- to a small number of mathematical input parameters, and the relationship between those parameters and a generated design is often unclear, making it difficult to iterate a design. We present Forte, a sketch-based, real-time interactive tool for people to directly express and iterate on their designs via 2D topology optimization. Users can ask the system to add structures, provide a variation with better performance, or optimize internal material layouts. Users can globally control how much to'deviate' from the initial sketch, or perform local suggestive editing, which interactively prompts the system to update based on the new information. Design sessions with 10 participants demonstrate that Forte empowers designers to create and explore a range of optimized designs with custom forms and styles.},

abstract = {We introduce a class of continuum shell structures, the Buckliball, which undergoes a structural transformation induced by buckling under pressure loading. The geometry of the Buckliball comprises a spherical shell patterned with a regular array of circular voids. In order for the pattern transformation to be induced by buckling, the possible number and arrangement of these voids are found to be restricted to five specific configurations. Below a critical internal pressure, the narrow ligaments between the voids buckle, leading to a cooperative buckling cascade of the skeleton of the ball. This ligament buckling leads to closure of the voids and a reduction of the total volume of the shell by up to 54{\%}, while remaining spherical, thereby opening the possibility of encapsulation. We use a combination of precision desktop-scale experiments, finite element simulations, and scaling analyses to explore the underlying mechanics of these foldable structures, finding excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement. Given that this folding mechanism is induced by a mechanical instability, our Buckliball opens the possibility for reversible encapsulation, over a wide range of length scales.},

Our process starts with measuring deformation properties of base materials. For each base material we acquire a set of example deformations, and we represent the material as a non-linear stress-strain relationship in a finite-element model. We have validated our material measure- ment process by comparing simulations of arbitrary stacks of base materials with measured deformations of fabricated material stacks. After material measurement, our process continues with designing stacked layers of base materials. We introduce an optimization pro- cess that finds the best combination of stacked layers that meets a user's criteria specified by example deformations. Our algorithm employs a number of strategies to prune poor solutions from the combinatorial search space.

abstract = {Figure 1: Our interactive editing system allows users to adapt the shape and motion of planar linkages in an intuitive manner. As shown on the Strandbeest sculpture (1 st from left), we support diverse edits including changes to the enclosure of the assembly (2 nd) or the shape of individual components (3 rd). Our editing tools preserve correct functioning at all times, as illustrated on a 3D-printed prototype (4 th). Abstract We present a method for interactive editing of planar linkages. Given a working linkage as input, the user can make targeted edits to the shape or motion of selected parts while preserving other, e.g., functionally-important aspects. In order to make this process intu-itive and efficient, we provide a number of editing tools at different levels of abstraction. For instance, the user can directly change the structure of a linkage by displacing joints, edit the motion of selected points on the linkage, or impose limits on the size of its enclosure. Our method safeguards against degenerate configura-tions during these edits, thus ensuring the correct functioning of the mechanism at all times. Linkage editing poses strict requirements on performance that standard approaches fail to provide. In order to enable interactive and robust editing, we build on a symbolic kine-matics approach that uses closed-form expressions instead of nu-merical methods to compute the motion of a linkage and its deriva-tives. We demonstrate our system on a diverse set of examples, illustrating the potential to adapt and personalize the structure and motion of existing linkages. To validate the feasibility of our edited designs, we fabricated two physical prototypes.},

abstract = {Mechanical metamaterials exhibit unusual properties through the shape and movement of their engineered subunits. This work presents a new investigation of the Poisson's ratios of a family of cellular metamaterials based on Kirigami design principles. Kirigami is the art of cutting and folding paper to obtain 3D shapes. This technique allows us to create cellular structures with engineered cuts and folds that produce large shape and volume changes, and with extremely directional, tuneable mechanical properties. We demonstrate how to produce these structures from flat sheets of composite materials. By a combination of analytical models and numerical simulations we show how these Kirigami cellular metamaterials can change their deformation characteristics. We also demonstrate the potential of using these classes of mechanical metamaterials for shape change applications like morphing structures.},

abstract = {Figure 1: Our design tool allows users to create physical surfaces structured with decorative patterns. Given a base shape and pattern exemplar (left), our method creates a distribution of stencils that are used to remove material from an otherwise solid surface. The result (center, right) is a physical surface that combines user-controlled aesthetics and structural integrity. Abstract We present a novel method to design shells with artistic cutouts in a manner that produces a stable final result. The process of stenciling, removing material with a fixed shape, is a particularly appealing way to introduce a decorative pattern into the design of architectural structures, furniture, or household objects. However, removing material can easily weaken an object to the point where its integrity is compromised, while purely functional distributions of cutouts lack the desired aesthetic compo-nent. We tackle this problem by combining aesthetics, stability, and material efficiency in an optimization that determines the distribution and scaling of these stencils in a way that complies as much as possible with both pattern and stability objectives. We demonstrate the capabilities of our system on examples from architecture, furniture design, and decorative items, and show how user interaction can be integrated to guide the aesthetics of the final result.},

Herein, we discuss the various advances in the emerging field of reconfigurable soft materials with a focus on the various parameters that can be modulated to control a complex system behavior. In particular, we detail approaches that use either long-range fields (i.e. electrical, magnetic) or changes in local thermodynamic parameters (e.g., solvent quality) in order to elicit a precise dimensional and controlled response. The theoretical underpinnings and practical considerations for different approaches are briefly presented alongside several illustrative examples from the recent studies. In the end, we summarize recent accomplishments, critical issues to consider, and give perspectives on the developments of this exciting research field.},

Our computational approach allows novice users to retarget an existing mechanical template to a user-specified input shape. Our proposed representation for a mechanical template encodes a parameterized mecha-nism, mechanical constraints that ensure a physically valid configuration, spatial relationships of mechanical parts to the user-provided shape, and functional constraints that specify an intended functionality. We provide an intuitive interface and optimization-in-the-loop approach for finding a valid configuration of the mechanism and the shape to ensure that higher-level functional goals are met. Our algorithm interactively optimizes the mecha-nism while the user manipulates the placement of mechanical components and the shape. Our system allows users to efficiently explore various design choices and to synthesize customized mechanical objects that can be fab-ricated with rapid prototyping technologies.

abstract = {A novel, fast, stable, physics-based numerical method for interactive simulation of elastically deformable objects is presented. Starting from elasticity theory, the deformation energy is modeled in terms of the positions of point masses using the linear shape functions of ﬁnite element analysis, providing for an exact correspondence between the known physical properties of deformable bodies such as Young's modulus, and the simulation parameter. By treating the inﬁnitely stiff case as a kinematic constraint on a system of point particles and using a regularization technique, a stable ﬁrst order stepping algorithm is constructed which allows the simulation of materials over the entire range of stiffness values, including incompressibility. The main cost of this method is the solution of a linear system of equations which is large but sparse. Commonly available sparse matrix packages can process this problem with linear complexity in the number of elements for many cases. This method is contrasted with other well-known point mass models of deformable solids which rely on penalty forces constructed from simple local geometric quantities, e.g., spring-and-damper models. For these, the mapping between the simulation parameters and the physical observables is not well deﬁned and they are either strongly limited to the low stiffness case when using explicit integration methods, or produce grossly inaccurate results when using simple linearly implicit method. Validation and timing tests on the new method show that it produces very good physical behavior at a moderate computational cost, and it is usable in the context of real-time interactive simulations.},

abstract = {Imbalance suggests a feeling of dynamism and movement in static objects. It is therefore not surprising that many 3D models stand in impossibly balanced configurations. As long as the models remain in a computer this is of no consequence: the laws of physics do not apply. However, fabrication through 3D printing breaks the illusion: printed models topple instead of standing as initially intended. We propose to assist users in producing novel, properly balanced designs by interactively deforming an existing model. We formulate balance optimization as an energy minimization, improving stability by modifying the volume of the object, while preserving its surface details. This takes place during interactive editing: the user cooperates with our optimizer towards the end result. We demonstrate our method on a variety of models. With our technique, users can produce fabricated objects that stand in one or more surprising poses without requiring glue or heavy pedestals.},

We build on work in the area of meta- materials, using numerical optimization to design tiled microstruc- tures with desired properties, but with the key difference that our method designs families of related structures that can be interpo- lated to smoothly vary the material properties over a wide range. To create an object with spatially varying elastic properties, we tile the object's interior with microstructures drawn from these families, generating a different microstructure for each cell using an efficient algorithm to select compatible structures for neighboring cells. We show results computed for both 2D and 3D objects, validating sev- eral 2D and 3D printed structures using standard material tests as well as demonstrating various example applications.},

The current approaches use fixed lenses or expensive phased arrays. Here, using a process of analogue-to-digital conversion and wavelet decomposition, we develop the notion of quantal meta-surfaces. The quanta here are small, pre-manufactured three-dimensional units - which we call metamaterial bricks - each encoding a specific phase delay. These bricks can be assembled into meta-surfaces to generate any diffraction-limited acoustic field. We apply this methodology to show experimental examples of acoustic focusing, steering and, after stacking single meta-surfaces into layers, the more complex field of an acoustic tractor beam. We demonstrate experimentally single-sided air-borne acoustic levitation using meta-layers at various bit-rates: from a 4-bit uniform to 3-bit non-uniform quantization in phase. This powerful methodology dramatically simplifies the design of acoustic devices and provides a key-step towards realising spatial sound modulators.},

abstract = {Synergistic integration of electromagnetic (EM) and mechanical properties of metamaterials, a concept known as smart metamaterials, promises new applications across the spectrum, from flexible waveguides to shape-conforming cloaks. These applications became possible thanks to smart transformation optics (STO), a design methodology that utilizes coordinate transformations to control both EM wave propagation and mechanical deformation of the device. Here, we demonstrate several STO devices based on extremely auxetic (Poisson ratio -1) elasto-electromagnetic metamaterials, both of which exhibit enormous flexibility and sustain efficient operation upon a wide range of deformations. Spatial maps of microwave electric fields across these devices confirm our ability to deform carpet cloaks, bent waveguides, and potentially other quasi-conformal TO-based devices operating at 7 {\~{}} 8 GHz. These devices are each fabricated from a single sheet of initially uniform (double-periodic) square-lattice metamaterial, which acquires the necessary distribution of effective permittivity entirely from the mechanical deformation of its boundary. By integrating transformation optics and continuum mechanics theory, we provide analytical derivations for the design of STO devices. Additionally, we clarify an important point relating to two-dimensional STO devices: the difference between plane stress and plane strain assumptions, which lead to elastic metamaterials with Poisson ratio -1 and -∞, respectively.},

abstract = {Digital fabrication machines such as 3D printers and laser-cutters allow users to produce physical objects based on virtual models. The creation process is currently unidirectional: once an object is fabricated it is separated from its originating virtual model. Consequently, users are tied into digital modeling tools, the virtual design must be completed before fabrication, and once fabricated, re-shaping the physical object no longer influences the digital model. To provide a more flexible design process that allows objects to iteratively evolve through both digital and physical input, we introduce bidirectional fabrication. To demonstrate the concept, we built ReForm, a system that integrates digital modeling with shape input, shape output, annotation for machine commands, and visual output. By continually synchronizing the physical object and digital model it supports object versioning to allow physical changes to be undone. Through application examples, we demonstrate the benefits of ReForm to the digital fabrication process.},

abstract = {We present a computational method for interactive 3D design and rationalization of surfaces via auxetic materials, i.e., flat flexible material that can stretch uniformly up to a certain extent. A key motivation for studying such material is that one can approximate doubly-curved surfaces (such as the sphere) using only flat pieces, making it attractive for fabrication. We physically realize surfaces by introducing cuts into approximately inextensible material such as sheet metal, plastic, or leather. The cutting pattern is modeled as a regular triangular linkage that yields hexagonal openings of spatially-varying radius when stretched. In the same way that isometry is fundamental to modeling developable surfaces, we leverage conformal geometry to understand auxetic design. In particular, we compute a global conformal map with bounded scale factor to initialize an otherwise intractable non-linear optimization. We demonstrate that this global approach can handle non-trivial topology and non-local dependencies inherent in auxetic material. Design studies and physical prototypes are used to illustrate a wide range of possible applications.},

abstract = {Balancing complexity and simplicity has played an important role in the development of many fields in science and engineering. One of the well-known and powerful examples of such balance can be found in Boolean algebra and its impact on the birth of digital electronics and the digital information age. The simplicity of using only two numbers, '0' and '1', in a binary system for describing an arbitrary quantity made the fields of digital electronics and digital signal processing powerful and ubiquitous. Here, inspired by the binary concept, we propose to develop the notion of digital metamaterials. Specifically, we investigate how one can synthesize an electromagnetic metamaterial with a desired permittivity, using as building blocks only two elemental materials, which we call 'metamaterial bits', with two distinct permittivity functions. We demonstrate, analytically and numerically, how proper spatial mixtures of such metamaterial bits lead to elemental 'metamaterial bytes' with effective material parameters that are different from the parameters of the metamaterial bits. We then apply this methodology to several design examples of optical elements, such as digital convex lenses, flat graded-index digital lenses, digital constructs for epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) supercoupling and digital hyperlenses, thus highlighting the power and simplicity of the methodology.},

abstract = {We present a technique for analyzing a set of animal gaits to predict the gait of a new animal from its shape alone. This method works on a wide range of bipeds and quadrupeds, and adapts the motion style to the size and shape of the animal. We achieve this by combining inverse optimization with sparse data interpolation. Starting with a set of reference walking gaits extracted from sagittal plane video footage, we first use inverse optimization to learn physically motivated parameters describing the style of each of these gaits. Given a new animal, we estimate the parameters describing its gait with sparse data interpolation, then solve a forward optimization problem to synthesize the final gait. To improve the realism of the results, we introduce a novel algorithm called joint inverse optimization which learns coherent patterns in motion style from a database of example animal-gait pairs. We quantify the predictive performance of our model by comparing its synthesized gaits to ground truth walking motions for a range of different animals. We also apply our method to the prediction of gaits for dinosaurs and other extinct creatures.},

abstract = {Shape-shifting of flat materials into the desired 3D configuration is an alternative design route for fabrication of complex 3D shapes, which provides many benefits such as access to the flat material surface and the ability to produce well-described motions. The advanced production techniques that primarily work in 2D could then be used to add complex surface features to the flat material. The combination of complex 3D shapes and surface-related functionalities has a wide range of applications in biotechnology, actuators/sensors, and engineering of complex metamaterials. Here, we categorize the different programming strategies that could be used for planning the shape-shifting of soft matter based on the type of stresses generated inside the flat material and present an overview of the ways those mechanisms could be used to achieve the desired 3D shapes. Stress gradients through the thickness of the material, which generate out-of-plane bending moments, and compressive in-plane stresses that result in out-of-plane buckling constitute the major mechanisms through which shape-shifting of the flat matter could be programmed. We review both programming strategies with a focus on the underlying physical principles, which are highly scalable and could be applied to other structures and materials. The techniques used for programming the time sequence of shape-shifting are discussed as well. Such types of so-called “sequential” shape-shifting enable achieving more complex 3D shapes, as the kinematics of the movements could be planned in time to avoid collisions. Ultimately, we discuss what 3D shapes could be achieved through shape-shifting from flat soft matter and identify multiple areas of application.},

abstract = {Abstract When designing a new nanostructure or microstructure, one can follow a processing?based manufacturing pathway, in which the structure properties are defined based on the processing capabilities of the fabrication method at hand. Alternatively, a performance?based pathway can be followed, where the envisioned performance is first defined, and then suitable fabrication methods are sought. To support the latter pathway, fabrication methods are here reviewed based on the geometric and material complexity, resolution, total size, geometric and material diversity, and throughput they can achieve, independently from processing capabilities. Ten groups of fabrication methods are identified and compared in terms of these seven moderators. The highest resolution is obtained with electron beam lithography, with feature sizes below 5 nm. The highest geometric complexity is attained with vat photopolymerization. For high throughput, parallel methods, such as photolithography (≈101 m2 h?1), are needed. This review offers a decision?making tool for identifying which method to use for fabricating a structure with predefined properties.},

In particular, their large deformability without topological change is one of their most interesting solid properties. In this study, we propose a bar-and-joint framework assembled with a basic unit of motion structure, which has eightfold rotational symmetry (MS-8). The MS-8 is made of tetragons, arranged in a concentric fashion, which are transformed into either one of two different aligned patterns of square cells according to the coordinated rotations of the inside squares. Square cells are extremely anisotropic, which is why the stiffness of the MS-8 changes dramatically in the transformation process. Thus, the MS-8 exhibits bi-stiffness according to the two different motions. Taking advantage of the bi-stiffness property, the possibilities of deformation behaviours for repetitive structures of MS-8s are discussed.},

A survey of common joint types is given, including folds, interlocking slots, bends, pivots, sliders, and rotating sliders. Also included is an overview of common one-piece and layered mechanisms, including single-slit, double-slit, V-fold, tent, tube strap, and arch mechanisms. Each mechanism or joint is shown using both a paper representation and either a rigid-body or pseudo-rigid-body representation. In addition, this paper shows that more complex mechanisms may be created by combining simple mechanisms in various ways. The principles presented are applied to the creation of new pop-up joints and mechanisms. The new mechanisms employ both spherical and spatial kinematic chains. Understanding pop-up mechanism kinematics could lead to new applications in deployable structures, packaging, and instruments for minimally invasive surgery.},

Many siliceous skeleton species--such as diatoms, sea sponges and radiolarians--have remarkably high strengths when compared with man-made materials of the same composition, yet are able to remain lightweight and porous. It has been suggested that these properties arise from the hierarchical arrangement of different structural elements at their relevant length scales. Here, we report the fabrication of hollow ceramic scaffolds that mimic the length scales and hierarchy of biological materials. The constituent solids attain tensile strengths of 1.75 GPa without failure even after multiple deformation cycles, as revealed by in situ nanomechanical experiments and finite-element analysis. We discuss the high strength and lack of failure in terms of stress concentrators at surface imperfections and of local stresses within the microstructural landscape. Our findings suggest that the hierarchical design principles offered by hard biological organisms can be applied to create damage-tolerant lightweight engineering materials.},

Users design objects in an immersive augmented reality environment, interact with virtual objects in a direct gestural manner and can introduce existing physical objects effortlessly into their designs. We describe the design and implementation of MixFab, a user-defined gesture study that informed this design, show artifacts designed with the system and describe a user study evaluating the system's prototype.},

Our method produces a single, connected object that can be physically fabricated and folded from one shape to the other. We segment the object into voxels and search for a voxel-tree that can fold from the input shape to the target shape. This involves three major steps: finding a good voxelization, finding the tree structure that can form the input and target shapes' configurations, and finding a non-intersecting folding sequence. We demonstrate our results on several input 3D objects and also physically fabricate some using a 3D printer.},

@article{Cali2012,
abstract = {Additive manufacturing (3D printing) is commonly used to produce physical models for a wide variety of applications, from archae- ology to design. While static models are directly supported, it is desirable to also be able to print models with functional articula- tions, such as a hand with joints and knuckles, without the need for manual assembly of joint components. Apart from having to address limitations inherent to the printing process, this poses a particular challenge for articulated models that should be posable: to allow the model to hold a pose, joints need to exhibit inter- nal friction to withstand gravity, without their parts fusing during 3D printing. This has not been possible with previous printable joint designs. In this paper, we propose a method for converting 3D models into printable, functional, non-assembly models with internal friction. To this end, we have designed an intuitive work- flow that takes an appropriately rigged 3D model, automatically fits novel 3D-printable and posable joints, and provides an interface for specifying rotational constraints. We show a number of results for different articulated models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.},

abstract = {We have been investigating the properties, behaviour and stability of multistable open corrugated shells. This multistability arises from the interaction between internal prestresses created during forming and non-linear geometrical changes during deformation. Two modes of bistability are described here: prestressed corrugated shells which, when buckled, can coil up into a tube repeatably and reversibly, and corrugated sheets with a global cylindrical curvature, which is stable in either of two symmetric directions. Both modes can be present at the same time, creating a tristable shell. Using simplified analytical elastic models, we homogenise the properties of the shells through simultaneously considering the material on two scales: the local scale of the isotropic material and the global scale of the corrugated sheet, which is then modelled as a homogenised, flat, anisotropic sheet. The models produce similar behaviour to our prototypes, and have taught us how to incorporate or eradicate the various modes at will. The insights and methods developed from these simple models are paving the way to developing more complex corrugated forms with even more general and interesting shape-changing characteristics.},

abstract = {Most conventional materials expand in transverse directions when they are compressed uniaxially resulting in the familiar positive Poisson's ratio. Here we develop a new class of two dimensional (2D) metamaterials with negative Poisson's ratio that contract in transverse directions under uniaxial compressive loads leading to auxeticity. This is achieved through mechanical instabilities (i.e., buckling) introduced by structural hierarchy and retained over a wide range of applied compression. This unusual behavior is demonstrated experimentally and analyzed computationally. The work provides new insights into the role of structural organization and hierarchy in designing 2D auxetic metamaterials, and new opportunities for developing energy absorbing materials, tunable membrane filters, and acoustic dampeners.},

Our research goal is to enable users to turn models produced on commodity 3D printers into interactive objects with a minimum of required assembly or instrumentation. We present Sauron, an embedded machine vision-based system for sensing human input on physical controls like buttons, sliders, and joysticks. With Sauron, designers attach a single camera with integrated ring light to a printed prototype. This camera observes the interior portions of input components to determine their state. In many prototypes, input components may be occluded or outside the viewing frustum of a single camera. We introduce algorithms that generate internal geometry and calculate mirror placements to redirect input motion into the visible camera area. To investigate the space of designs that can be built with Sauron along with its limitations, we built prototype devices, evaluated the suitability of existing models for vision sensing, and performed an informal study with three CAD users. While our approach imposes some constraints on device design, results suggest that it is expressive and accessible enough to enable constructing a useful variety of devices.},

The new algorithm derives the covering problem directly and implicitly without generating the set of all prime implicants. It then generates only those prime implicants involved in the covering problem. A set of primes is represented by the cube of their intersection. Therefore, the unique set of sets of primes that forms the covering problem can be implicitly represented by a set of cubes that forms a minimum canonical cover. The minimum canonical cover starting from any initial cover is obtained and then the covering problem is derived. The method is effective; it improves on the runtime and memory usage of ESPRESSO-EXACT by average factors of 1.78 and 1.19, respectively, on the 114 of 134 benchmark examples that could be completed by ESPRESSO-EXACT. Of the remaining 20 hard problems, 14 are solved exactly. For three of the remaining six, the covering problem is derived but it can not be solved exactly.},

Haptic experience design, which is woven together with other multisensory design efforts, interfaces is now becoming part of many designers' jobs. We can expect it to present unique challenges, and yet we know almost nothing of what it looks like “in the wild” due to the field's relative youth, its technical complexity, the multisensory interactions between haptics, sight, and sound, and the difficulty of accessing practitioners in professional and proprietary environments. In this paper, we analyze interviews with six professional haptic designers to document and articulate haptic experience design by observing designers' goals and processes and finding themes at three levels of scope: the multisensory nature of haptic experiences, a map of the collaborative ecosystem, and the cultural context of haptics. Our findings are augmented by feedback obtained in a recent design workshop at an international haptics conference. We find that haptic designers follow a familiar design process, but face specific challenges when working with haptics. We capture and summarize these challenges, make concrete recommendations to conquer them, and present a vision for the future of haptic experience design.},

abstract = {Programmable matter is a material whose properties can be programmed to achieve specific shapes or stiffnesses upon command. This concept requires constituent elements to interact and rearrange intelligently in order to meet the goal. This paper considers achieving programmable sheets that can form themselves in different shapes autonomously by folding. Past approaches to creating transforming machines have been limited by the small feature sizes, the large number of components, and the associated complexity of communication among the units. We seek to mitigate these difficulties through the unique concept of self-folding origami with universal crease patterns. This approach exploits a single sheet composed of interconnected triangular sections. The sheet is able to fold into a set of predetermined shapes using embedded actuation. To implement this self-folding origami concept, we have developed a scalable end-to-end planning and fabrication process. Given a set of desired objects, the system computes an optimized design for a single sheet and multiple controllers to achieve each of the desired objects. The material, called programmable matter by folding, is an example of a system capable of achieving multiple shapes for multiple functions.},

@article{Mankame2006,
abstract = {We describe a method for discretizing planar C2-regular domains immersed in non-conforming triangulations. The method consists in constructing mappings from triangles in a background mesh to curvilinear ones that conform exactly to the immersed domain. Constructing such a map relies on a novel way of parameterizing the immersed boundary over a collection of nearby edges with its closest point projection. By interpolating the mappings to curvilinear triangles at select points, we recover isoparametric mappings for the immersed domain defined over the background mesh. Indeed, interpolating the constructed mappings just at the vertices of the background mesh yields a fast meshing algorithm that involves only perturbing a few vertices near the boundary. For the discretization of a curved domain to be robust, we have to impose restrictions on the background mesh. Conversely, these restrictions define a family of domains that can be discretized with a given background mesh. We then say that the background mesh is a universal mesh for such a family of domains. The notion of universal meshes is particularly useful in free/moving boundary problems because the same background mesh can serve as the universal mesh for the evolving domain for time intervals that are independent of the time step. Hence it facilitates a framework for finite element calculations over evolving domains while using a fixed background mesh. Furthermore, since the evolving geometry can be approximated with any desired order, numerical solutions can be computed with high-order accuracy. We demonstrate these ideas with various numerical examples.},

@article{Merkle1993,
abstract = {Molecular mechanical logic devices have been proposed as a method of eventually achieving very small size (device volumes of a few cubic nanometers) and thus of achieving very high packing densities. However, the heat generated by mole quantities of molecular mechanical logic devices packed into a small volume can be a major problem. Previous mechanical logic devices (in which the logic gates in a digital system are implemented using mechanical components) required that some part slide or rotate past another part, resulting in friction and heat generation when the parts move. This is not an inherent requirement in the operation of mechanical logic. This paper describes two types of mechanical reversible logic which eliminate sliding contact. In the first type contact between parts, when it does occur, involves only pressure. In the second, all contact between parts is eliminated. The entire computation could in principle be performed by a single block of complexly shaped oscillating elastic material. The state of the computation is stored in the elastic deformations of this single block. If the material is perfectly elastic, the resulting computer will dissipate no energy. Real material moving sufficiently slowly can approximate a perfectly elastic material as closely as desired. In real materials, energy dissipation occurs during successive cycles of compression and decompression of the material much as energy dissipation occurs when a gas is compressed by a piston. However, at sufficiently low temperatures, this mechanism of energy dissipation might no longer be operative. It is not impossible that energy dissipation can be made to fall exponentially as both temperature and speed of operation are reduced.},

abstract = {Mechanical metamaterials are artificial structures with unusual properties, such as negative Poisson ratio, bistability or tunable vibrational properties, that originate in the geometry of their unit cell. At the heart of such unusual behaviour is often a soft mode: a motion that does not significantly stretch or compress the links between constituent elements. When activated by motors or external fields, soft modes become the building blocks of robots and smart materials. Here, we demonstrate the existence of topological soft modes that can be positioned at desired locations in a metamaterial while being robust against a wide range of structural deformations or changes in material parameters. These protected modes, localized at dislocations, are the mechanical analogue of topological states bound to defects in electronic systems. We create physical realizations of the topological modes in prototypes of kagome lattices built out of rigid triangular plates. We show mathematically that they originate from the interplay between two Berry phases: the Burgers vector of the dislocation and the topological polarization of the lattice. Our work paves the way towards engineering topologically protected nano-mechanical structures for molecular robotics or information storage and read-out.},

To develop these transformable foods, we performed material-based design, established a hybrid fabrication strategy, and conducted performance simulation. Users can customize food shape transformations through a pre-defined simulation platform, and then fabricate these designed patterns using additive manufacturing. Three application techniques are provided - 2D-to-3D folding, hydration-induced wrapping, and temperature-induced self-fragmentation, to present the shape, texture, and interaction with food materials.

Furthermore, both audible sound and inaudible ultrasound can be produced with the same design, allowing for identifying and tracking 3D printed objects in space using common integrated microphones. The design of 3D printed speakers is based on electrostatic loudspeaker technology first explored in the early 1930s but not broadly applied until now. These speakers are simpler than common electromagnetic speakers, while allowing for sound reproduction at 60 dB levels with arbitrary directivity ranging from focused to omnidirectional. Our research of 3D printed speakers contributes to the growing body of work exploring functional 3D printing in interactive applications.},

abstract = {Purpose – Digital materials are composed of many discrete voxels placed in a massively parallel layer deposition process, as opposed to continuous (analog) deposition techniques. The purpose of this paper is to explore the wide range of material properties attainable using a voxel-based freeform fabrication process, and demonstrate in simulation the versatility of fabricating with multiple materials in this manner. Design/methodology/approach – A representative interlocking voxel geometry was selected, and a nonlinear physics simulator was implemented to perform virtual tensile tests on blocks of assembled voxels of varying materials. Surface contact between tiles, plastic deformation of the individual voxels, and varying manufacturing precision were all modeled. Findings – By varying the precision, geometry, and material of the individual voxels, continuous control over the density, elastic modulus, coefficient of thermal expansion, ductility, and failure mode of the material is obtained. Also, the effects of several hierarchical voxel “microstructures” are demonstrated, resulting in interesting properties such as negative Poisson's ratio. Research limitations/implications – This analysis is a case study of a specific voxel geometry, which is representative of 2.5D interlocking shapes but not necessarily all types of interlocking voxels. Practical implications – The results imply that digital materials can exhibit widely varying and tunable properties in a single desktop fabrication process. Originality/value – The paper explores the vast potential of tunable materials, especially using the concept of voxel microstructure, applicable primarily to 3D voxel printers but also to other multi-material freeform fabrication processes.},

abstract = {A significant challenge in conventional heat-shrinkable polymers is to produce controllable microstructures. Here we report that the polymer material fabricated by three-dimensional (3D) printing technique has a heat-shrinkable property, whose initial microstructure can undergo a spontaneous pattern transformation under heating. The underlying mechanism is revealed by evaluating internal strain of the printed polymer from its fabricating process. It is shown that a uniform internal strain is stored in the polymer during the printing process and can be released when heated above its glass transition temperature. Furthermore, the internal strain can be used to trigger the pattern transformation of the heat-shrinkable polymer in a controllable way. Our work provides insightful ideas to understand a novel mechanism on the heat-shrinkable effect of printed material, but also to present a simple approach to fabricate heat-shrinkable polymer with a controllable thermo-structural response.},

Provided with a user-supplied 3D shape and target sound characteristics of the desired frequencies and their amplitudes, our method optimizes the geometry of the object to realize the desired sound (see video). Abstract Metallophones such as glockenspiels produce sounds in response to contact. Building these instruments is a complicated process, limiting their shapes to well-understood designs such as bars. We automatically optimize the shape of arbitrary 2D and 3D objects through deformation and perforation to produce sounds when struck which match user-supplied frequency and amplitude spectra. This optimization requires navigating a complex energy landscape, for which we develop Latin Complement Sampling to both speed up finding minima and provide probabilistic bounds on landscape exploration. Our method produces instruments which perform similarly to those that have been professionally-manufactured, while also expanding the scope of shape and sound that can be realized, e.g., single object chords. Furthermore, we can optimize sound spectra to create overtones and to dampen specific frequencies. Thus our technique allows even novices to design metallophones with unique sound and appearance.},

abstract = {States of self-stress, tensions and compressions of structural elements that result in zero net forces, are ultimately responsible for the load-bearing ability of structures ranging from bridges to metamaterials with tunable mechanical properties. We exploit a class of recently introduced states of self-stress analogous to topological quantum states to sculpt localized buckling regions in the interior of periodic cellular metamaterials. Although the topological states of self stress arise in the linear response of an idealized mechanical frame of harmonic springs connected by freely-hinged joints, they leave a distinct signature in the nonlinear buckling behaviour of a cellular material built out of elastic beams with rigid joints. The salient feature of these localized buckling regions is that they are indistinguishable from their surroundings as far as material parameters or connectivity of their constituent elements are concerned. Furthermore, they are robust against a wide range of structural perturbations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this topological design through analytical and numerical calculations as well as buckling experiments performed on two- and three-dimensional metamaterials built out of kagome lattices.},

@article{Takayama2010,
abstract = {The modeling of volumetric objects is still a difficult problem. Solid texture synthesis methods enable the design of volumes with homo- geneous textures, but global features such as smoothly varying col- ors seen in vegetables and fruits are difficult to model. In this paper, we propose a representation called diffusion surfaces (DSs) to en- able modeling such objects. DSs consist of 3D surfaces with colors defined on both sides, such that the interior colors in the volume are obtained by diffusing colors from nearby surfaces. A straightfor- ward way to compute color diffusion is to solve a volumetric Pois- son equation with the colors of the DSs as boundary conditions, but it requires expensive volumetric meshing which is not appropriate for interactive modeling. We therefore propose to interpolate colors only locally at user-defined cross-sections using a modified version of the positive mean value coordinates algorithm to avoid volumet- ric meshing. DSs are generally applicable to model many differ- ent kinds of objects with internal structures. As a case study, we present a simple sketch-based interface for modeling objects with rotational symmetries that can also generate random variations of models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through various DSs models with simple non-photorealistic rendering tech- niques enabled by DSs.},

They consist of small rigid tiles that are tightly held together by two pre-stretched elastic sheets attached to them. Our method allows the realization of smooth, doubly curved surfaces that can be fabricated as a flat piece. Once released, the restoring forces of the pre-stretched sheets support the object to take shape in 3D. CurveUps are structurally stable in their target configuration. The design process starts with a target surface. Our method generates a tile layout in 2D and optimizes the distribution, shape, and attachment areas of the tiles to obtain a configuration that is fabricable and in which the curved up state closely matches the target. Our approach is based on an efficient approximate model and a local optimization strategy for an otherwise intractable nonlinear optimization problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for a wide range of shapes, all realized as physical prototypes.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the construction of materials with arbitrary prescribed positive semi-definite constitutive tensors. The construction problem can be called an inverse problem of finding a material with given homogenized coefficients. The inverse problem is formulated as a topology optimization problem i.e. finding the interior topology of a base cell such that cost is minimized and the constraints are defined by the prescribed constitutive parameters. Numerical values of the constitutive parameters of a given material are found using a numerical homogenization method expressed in terms of element mutual energies. Numerical results show that arbitrary materials, including materials with Poisson's ratio -1.0 and other extreme materials, can be obtained by modelling the base cell as a truss structure. Furthermore, a wide spectrum of materials can be constructed from base cells modelled as continuous discs of varying thickness. Only the two-dimensional case is considered in this paper but formulation and numerical procedures can easily be extended to the three-dimensional case. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {This paper unites two major legacies of James Clerk Maxwell's ground-breaking paper, " On Reciprocal Figures, Frames, and Diagrams of Forces " (Maxwell, Phi-los Mag 26:250-261, 1864; Edinb Roy Soc Proc 7:160–208, 1870): (i) the fundamental theorem used by Michell (Phi-los Mag 8(47):589–597, 1904) to derive trusses of least weight and (ii) reciprocal frames. This paper presents some remarkable relationships between discrete Michell frames and their corresponding reciprocal force polygons using Graphic Statics. Several examples are given to illustrate the notions of duality and self-reciprocity in these diagrams, with particular emphasis placed on discrete optimal bench-mark structures. For a given connectivity of nodes, Graphic Statics provides all of the information needed to deter-mine the total load path of the structure in the form and force diagrams. Because the form and force diagrams are reciprocal, in the course of finding one minimum load path structure, a second minimum load path structure is also found. These observations between the corresponding form and force diagrams are generalized for discrete cantilever Michell frames, and several comments on the extensions of this work are included.},

Such geometries are being progressively employed in the development of novel products, especially in the fields of intelligent expandable actuators, shape morphing structures and minimally invasive implantable devices. Although several auxetic and potentially auxetic geometries have been summarized in previous reviews and research, precise information regarding relevant properties for design tasks is not always provided. In this study we present a comparative study of two-dimensional and three-dimensional auxetic geometries carried out by means of computer-aided design and engineering tools (from now on CAD–CAE). The first part of the study is focused on the development of a CAD library of auxetics. Once the library is developed we simulate the behavior of the different auxetic geometries and elaborate a systematic comparison, considering relevant properties of these geometries, such as Poisson ratio(s), maximum volume or area reductions attainable and equivalent Young's modulus, hoping it may provide useful information for future designs of devices based on these interesting structures.},

@phdthesis{Olsson2012,
abstract = {In the pursuit of performance-based architecture there is an increased demand for integration between engineers and architects, between analysis and design. The key to make wise choices early in a design process, has previously been based on experience from prior work and experiments with physical models. With modern computational power those choices can be supplemented with real-time feedback from analysis tools. But few programs are designed for the type of light weight, real-time analysis that can be useful in the exploration of an architectural concept. This has been the target for a research and development team, SMART Solutions, at Buro Happold. SMART Form is a tool for performance-based architecture as a plug-in for the 3D modeling software Rhinoceros. It combines analysis and rationalization of complex geometries with form finding and sculpting of structures, driven by a dynamic relaxation solver. The plugin transforms the 3D modeling software to a virtual physical environment, influenced by various forces and a gravitational field. It enables sketching and sculpting of efficient compression (shells and gridshells) and tension structures (cable nets and membranes). The purpose for the thesis has been to advance SMART Form by implementing beam elements and explore how bending action can be used in the form finding process, allowing for a compromise between initial geometry and fully form found geometry. Automatic sizing of the beam elements is also implemented as a method to evaluate form. The thesis leads to an investigation of how to conduct conceptual structural design, and how this process can potentially be approached differently with the means of real-time feedback from analysis, form finding and sizing. In order to allow for real-time analysis an iterative technique called dynamic relaxation is used as the computational solver. As a result of the exploration of form finding with bending action a method called Limit control form finding was developed. This method enables form optimization of the most critical parts of a structure by specifying a limit for the bending capability of the elements. It was found to work in a good way for 2D structures but sometimes resulting in a less appealing, wrinkled looking grids for 3D structures. Dynamic relaxation is found to be a suitable method for real time analysis, although with some important issues regarding speed. The number of iterations needed to reach convergence is concluded to depend on the relation between local and global stiffness for each node in the structure. Hence the method works efficiently for some types of structural configuration (for example gridshells with a locally weak direction), while a conventional matrix solver would perhaps be more suitable for other cases (for example space truss structures). The implemented functionality, such as form finding using cables, limit control and automatic sizing is demonstrated with a couple of test cases. One of which is the Exeter gridshell roof where engineers at Buro Happold have been involved from the concept design to the realized structure. The real design process for the project is shown and new approach based on real time feedback is demonstrated. With the new functionality implemented during the thesis, SMART Form has become a much more sophisticated tool, and a great improvement for the design process of the Exeter roof could be made. Due to the possibilities of a quick and efficient collaborative design process, that comes with the new tool, it seems to offer great potential in bridging between engineers and architects in structural concept design.

An existing homogenisation model for a lattice structure is combined with an analytical strain energy model from the literature to show the mechanical properties needed to construct an initially developable, bistable grid shell.

A coustic metamaterials are artificially designed mechanical structures with the purpose of obtaining emergent functionalities such as vibration isolation, acoustic cloaking or adaptive behaviour. In this Commentary, I review how a recently established bridge between the phenomenology of electrons in topological insulators 1–3 and the world of classical mechanical systems might lead to new design principles for such metamaterials. At first sight, there seems to be an unbridgeable gap between the quantum mechanical description of electrons in solids on the one hand and Newton's equations of motion describing mechanical modes, or phonons, on the other. When it comes to geometric or topological properties, however, this need not be the case. To understand this connection, let us remind ourselves of the Foucault pendulum. In 1851, L{\'{e}}on Foucault demonstrated the rotation of the Earth by showing that the plane of swing of a pendulum rotates throughout the day. This rotation obtained a beautiful geometric description with the introduction of the concept of parallel transport more than 60 years later 4},

The building blocks for constructing this composite are what we call extremal materials. These are composites of the two phases which are extremely stiff to a set of arbitrary given stresses and, at the same time, are extremely compliant to any orthogonal stress. An appropriately chosen subset of the extremal materials are layered together to form the composite with elasticity tensor matching the given tensor.},

Numerous works have shown potential to revolutionize the field of four-dimensional (4D) printing and active self-deploying structures. Conventional manufacturing technologies restrict the geometric complexity of active structures. 3D printing allows the fabrication of complex active structures with no assembly required. In this study, we propose active 3D printed auxetic meta-materials that are capable of achieving area changes up to 200{\%}. With these meta-materials, we design geometrically complex active structures that can be programmed into versatile shapes and recover their original shape given an external stimulus. We simulate the proposed meta-materials based on thermoviscoelastic material properties obtained by experimental characterization. A reduced beam model is constructed to predict forces and deformations of complex active structures. Excellent correlation is found between f...},

The ability of the design method to find a mechanism with complex output behavior is demonstrated by several examples.

To our surprise, we find that buckling induces complex ordered patterns which can be tuned by controlling the porosity of the structures. Our analysis reveals that the connected geometry of the cellular structure plays a crucial role in the generation of ordered states in this frustrated system.},

Current auxetic designs, however, are often monostable and cannot maintain the transformed shape upon load removal. Here, inspired by ancient geometric motifs arranged in square and triangular grids, we introduce a class of switchable architected materials exhibiting simultaneous auxeticity and structural bistability. The material concept is experimentally realized by perforating various cut motifs into a sheet of rubber, thus creating a network of rotating units connected with compliant hinges. The metamaterial performance is assessed through mechanical testing and accurately predicted by a coherent set of finite element simulations. A discussion on a rich set of mechanical phenomena follows to shed light on the main design principles governing bistable auxetics.},

Flexibles add expressive deformation input to interaction with on-screen tangibles. Based on different types of deformation mapping, we contribute a set of 3D-printable mechanisms that capture pressing, squeezing, and bending input with multiple levels of intensities. They can be integrated into 3D printed objects with custom geometries and on different locations. A Flexible is printed in a single pass on a consumer-level 3D printer without requiring further assembly. Through a series of interactive prototypes, example applications and a technical evaluation, we show the technical feasibility and the wide applicability of Flexibles.},

abstract = {Most materials have a unique form optimized for a specific property and function. However, the ability to reconfigure material structures depending on stimuli opens exciting opportunities. Although mechanical instabilities have been traditionally viewed as a failure mode, here we exploit them to design a class of 2D soft materials whose architecture can be dramatically changed in response to an external stimulus. By considering geometric constraints on the tessellations of the 2D Euclidean plane, we have identified four possible periodic distributions of uniform circular holes where mechanical instability can be exploited to reversibly switch between expanded (i.e. with circular holes) and compact (i.e. with elongated, almost closed elliptical holes) periodic configurations. Interestingly, in all these structures buckling is found to induce large negative values of incremental Poisson's ratio and in two of them also the formation of chiral patterns. Using a combination of finite element simulations and experiments at the centimeter scale we demonstrate a proof-of-concept of the proposed materials. Since the proposed mechanism for reconfigurable materials is induced by elastic instability, it is reversible, repeatable and scale-independent.},

Material composition is defined based on voxel resolution and used to fabricate a design object with locally varying material stiffness, aiming to satisfy the design objective. In this workflow voxel resolution is set by the printer's native resolution, eliminating the need for slicing and path planning. Controlling geometry and material property variation at the resolution of the printer provides significantly greater control over structure-property-function relationships. To demonstrate the utility of the bitmap printing approach we apply it to the design of a customized prosthetic socket. Pressure-sensing elements are concurrently fabricated with the socket, providing possibilities for evaluation of the socket's fit. The level of control demonstrated in this study cannot be achieved using traditional CAD tools and volume-based AM workflows, implying that new CAD workflows must be developed in order to enable designers to harvest the capabilities of AM.},

Facade is a crowdsourced fabrication pipeline that enables blind people to make flat physical interfaces accessible by independently producing a 3D-printed overlay of tactile buttons. From left to right, we demonstrate example applications including microwave, refrigerator door, copier, and another microwave. Insets shows close views of individual embossed buttons. ABSTRACT Common appliances have shifted toward flat interface pan­ els, making them inaccessible to blind people. Although blind people can label appliances with Braille stickers, doing so generally requires sighted assistance to identify the origi­ nal functions and apply the labels. We introduce Facade—a crowdsourced fabrication pipeline to help blind people inde­ pendently make physical interfaces accessible by adding a 3D printed augmentation of tactile buttons overlaying the original panel. Facade users capture a photo of the appliance with a readily available fiducial marker (a dollar bill) for recovering size information. This image is sent to multiple crowd workers, who work in parallel to quickly label and describe elements of the interface. Facade then generates a 3D model for a layer of tactile and pressable buttons that fits over the original controls. Finally, a home 3D printer or commercial service fabricates the layer, which is then aligned and attached to the interface by the blind person. We demonstrate the viability of Facade in a study with 11 blind participants.},

It simplifies the construction of convincing deformable models by avoiding complex selection and tuning of physical material parameters, yet retaining the richness of non-linear heterogeneous behavior. We acquire a set of example deformations of a real object, and represent each of them as a spatially varying stress-strain relationship in a finite-element model. We then model the material by non-linear interpolation of these stress-strain relationships in strain-space. Our method relies on a simple-to-build capture system and an efficient run-time simulation algorithm based on incremental loading, making it suitable for interactive computer graphics applications. We present the results of our approach for several non-linear materials and biological soft tissue, with accurate agreement of our model to the measured data.},

Most such materials are characterized by a fixed geometry, but in the design of some materials it is possible to incorporate internal mechanisms capable of reconfiguring their spatial architecture, and in this way to enable tunable functionality. Inspired by the structural diversity and foldability of the prismatic geometries that can be constructed using the snapology origami technique, here we introduce a robust design strategy based on space-filling tessellations of polyhedra to create three-dimensional reconfigurable materials comprising a periodic assembly of rigid plates and elastic hinges. Guided by numerical analysis and physical prototypes, we systematically explore the mobility of the designed structures and identify a wide range of qualitatively different deformations and internal rearrangements. Given that the underlying principles are scale-independent, our strategy can be applied to the design of the next generation of reconfigurable structures and materials, ranging from metre-scale transformable architectures to nanometre-scale tunable photonic systems.},

Recent advances in multimaterial fabrication techniques enable continuous shapes to be fabricated with unprecedented fidelity unhindered by spatial constraints and homogeneous materials. We address the challenges of exploitation of the freedom of this vast new design space using evolutionary algorithms. We first show a set of cantilever beams automatically designed to deflect in arbitrary static profiles using hard and soft materials. These beams were automatically fabricated, and their physical performance was confirmed within 0.5-7.6{\%} accuracy. We then demonstrate the automatic design of freeform soft robots for forward locomotion using soft volumetrically expanding actuator materials. One robot was fabricated automatically and assembled, and its performance was confirmed with 15{\%} error. We suggest that this approach to design automation opens the door to leveraging the full potential of the freeform multimaterial design space to generate novel mechanisms and deformable robots.},

abstract = {Extreme deformation can drastically morph a structure from one structural form into another. Programming such deformation properties into the structure is often challenging and in many cases an impossible task. The morphed forms do not hold and usually relapse to the original form, where the structure is in its lowest energy state. For example, a stick, when bent, resists its bent form and tends to go back to its initial straight form, where it holds the least amount of potential energy. In this project, we present a computational design method which can create fabricable planar structure that can morph into two different bistable forms. Once the user provides the initial desired forms, the method automatically creates support structures (internal springs), such that, the structure can not only morph, but also hold the respective forms under external force application. We achieve this through an iterative nonlinear optimization strategy for shaping the potential energy of the structure in the two forms simultaneously. Our approach guarantees first and second-order stability with respect to the potential energy of the bistable structure.},

Various characteristics of existing technologies, such as the high voltages required to trigger electroactive polymers ( {\textgreater} 1KV), low strain ( {\textless} 10{\%}) of shape memory alloys and the need for external compressors and pressure-regulating components for hydraulic or pneumatic fluidicelastomer actuators, limit their practicality for untethered applications. Here we show a single self-contained soft robust composite material that combines the elastic properties of a polymeric matrix and the extreme volume change accompanying liquid–vapor transition. The material combines a high strain (up to 900{\%}) and correspondingly high stress (up to 1.3 MPa) with low density (0.84 g cm−3). Along with its extremely low cost (about 3 cent per gram), simplicity of fabrication and environment-friendliness, these properties could enable new kinds of electrically driven entirely soft robots.},

abstract = {Artificial muscles hold promise for safe and powerful actuation for myriad common machines and robots. However, the design, fabrication, and implementation of artificial muscles are often limited by their material costs, operating principle, scalability, and single-degree-of-freedom contractile actuation motions. Here we propose an architecture for fluid-driven origami-inspired artificial muscles. This concept requires only a compressible skeleton, a flexible skin, and a fluid medium. A mechanical model is developed to explain the interaction of the three components. A fabrication method is introduced to rapidly manufacture low-cost artificial muscles using various materials and at multiple scales. The artificial muscles can be programed to achieve multiaxial motions including contraction, bending, and torsion. These motions can be aggregated into systems with multiple degrees of freedom, which are able to produce controllable motions at different rates. Our artificial muscles can be driven by fluids at negative pressures (relative to ambient). This feature makes actuation safer than most other fluidic artificial muscles that operate with positive pressures. Experiments reveal that these muscles can contract over 90{\%} of their initial lengths, generate stresses of ∼600 kPa, and produce peak power densities over 2 kW/kg-all equal to, or in excess of, natural muscle. This architecture for artificial muscles opens the door to rapid design and low-cost fabrication of actuation systems for numerous applications at multiple scales, ranging from miniature medical devices to wearable robotic exoskeletons to large deployable structures for space exploration.},

abstract = {We present a new type of 3D printer that can form precise, but soft and deformable 3D objects from layers of off-the-shelf fabric. Our printer employs an approach where a sheet of fabric forms each layer of a 3D object. The printer cuts this sheet along the 2D contour of the layer using a laser cutter and then bonds it to previously printed layers using a heat sensitive adhesive. Surrounding fabric in each layer is temporarily retained to provide a removable support structure for layers printed above it. This process is repeated to build up a 3D object layer by layer. Our printer is capable of automatically feeding two separate fabric types into a single print. This allows specially cut layers of conductive fabric to be embedded in our soft prints. Using this capability we demonstrate 3D models with touch sensing capability built into a soft print in one complete printing process, and a simple LED display making use of a conductive fabric coil for wireless power reception.},

abstract = {A single-piece contact-aided compliant mechanism (CCM) deforms to use one or many contact interactions to deliver the prescribed intricate inputoutput functionality. We present an automated synthesis procedure to design CCMs to trace large, non-smooth paths. Such paths can be traced by rigid-body or partially compliant mechanisms as well but the complexity, bulkiness and the presence of hinges is a disadvantage in terms of increased friction, backlash, need for lubrication, noise, and vibrations. In designing CCMs, both curved frame and two-dimensional finite elements are employed to represent the continuum and simulate the formation of contact sites. A contact site is one that allows relative rotation/sliding of a deforming member with respect to the neighboring one it is in contact with. The proposed design algorithm uses commercial software for large displacement contact analysis. The overall procedure automatically determines the CCM topology, feature shapes and sizes, and therefore the number (e.g., single or multiple) and nature (e.g., stiction or sliding) of contact sites. It systematically favors the continuum designs with lower function values when the synthesis problem is posed using a minimization objective. Synthesis of CCMs is exemplified for path generation applications though the proposed method can be employed for any generic kinematic task. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2012 by ASME.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the drawbacks of typical flexure connectors and presents several new designs for highly effective, kinematically well-behaved compliant joints. A revolute and a translational compliant joint are proposed, both of which offer great improvements over existing flexures in the qualities of (1) a large range of motion, (2) minimal “axis drift,” (3) increased off-axis stiffness, and (4) a reduced stress-concentrations. Analytic stiffness equations are developed for each joint and parametric computer models are used to verify their superior stiffness properties. A catalog of design charts based on the parametric models is also presented, allowing for rapid sizing of the joints for custom performance. A joint range of motion has been calculated with finite element analysis, including stress concentration effects.},

For the hardware, we suggest a magnetic assembly–based modular design. These modularized parts can be easily and precisely reconfigured with off-the-shelf or easy-to-machine parts that can meet different processing requirements such as mechanical mixing, chemical reaction, light activation, and solution vaporization. In addition, xPrint supports an open-source, highly customizable software design and simulation platform, which is applicable for simulating and facilitating smart material constructions. Furthermore, compared to inkjet or pneumatic syringe–based printing systems, xPrint has a large range of printable materials from synthesized polymers to natural micro-organism-living cells with a printing resolution from 10µm up to 5mm (droplet size). In this paper, we will introduce the system design in detail and three use cases to demonstrate the material variability and the customizability for users with different demands (e.g., designers, scientific researchers, or artists).},

@article{Pozniak2013,
abstract = {Two simple models of two-dimensional auxetic (i.e. negative Poisson's ratio) foams are studied by computer simulations. In the first one, further referred to as a Y-model, the ribs forming the cells of the foam are connected at points corresponding to sites of a disordered honeycomb lattice. In the second one, coined a -model, the connections of the ribs are not point-like but spatial. For simplicity, they are represented by triangles centered at the honeycomb lattice points. Three kinds of joints are considered for each model, soft, normal and hard, respectively corresponding to materials with Young's modulus ten times smaller than, equal to and ten times larger than that of the ribs. The initial lattices are uniformly compressed, which decreases their linear dimensions by about 15{\%}. The resulting structures are then used as reference structures with no internal stress. The Poisson's ratios of these reference structures are determined by stretching them, in either the x or the y direction. The results obtained for finite meshes and finite samples are extrapolated to infinitely fine mesh and to the thermodynamic limit, respectively. The extrapolations indicate that meshes with as few as 13 nodes across a rib and samples as small as containing 16×16 cells approximate the Poisson's ratios of systems of infinite size and infinite mesh resolution within the statistical accuracy of the experiments, i.e. a few per cent. The simulations show that by applying harder joints one can reach lower Poisson's ratios, i.e. foams with more auxetic properties. It also follows from the simulations performed that the -model gives lower Poisson's ratios than the Y-model. Finally, the simulations using fine meshes for the samples are compared with the ones in which the ribs are approximated by Timoshenko beams. Taking into account simplifications in the latter model, the agreement is surprisingly good.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.Everyone, from a shopper buying shoes to a doctor palpating a growth, uses their sense of touch to learn about the world. 3D printing is a powerful technology because it gives us the ability to control the haptic impression an object creates. This is critical for both replicating existing, real-world constructs and designing novel ones. However, each 3D printer has different capabilities and supports different materials, leaving us to ask: How can we best replicate a given haptic result on a particular output device? In this work, we address the problem of mapping a real-world material to its nearest 3D printable counterpart by constructing a perceptual model for the compliance of nonlinearly elastic objects. We begin by building a perceptual space from experimentally obtained user comparisons of twelve 3D-printed metamaterials. By comparing this space to a number of hypothetical computational models, we identify those that can be used to accurately and efficiently evaluate human-perceived differences in nonlinear stiffness. Furthermore, we demonstrate how such models can be applied to complex geometries in an interaction-aware way where the compliance is influenced not only by the material properties from which the object is made but also its geometry. We demonstrate several applications of our method in the context of fabrication and evaluate them in a series of user experiments.},

While most current reconfigurable designs are application specific, here we present a mechanical metamaterial with tunable shape, volume and stiffness. Our approach exploits a simple modular origami-like design consisting of rigid faces and hinges, which are connected to form a periodic structure consisting of extruded cubes. We show both analytically and experimentally that the transformable metamaterial has three degrees of freedom, which can be actively deformed into numerous specific shapes through embedded actuation. The proposed metamaterial can be used to realize transformable structures with arbitrary architectures, highlighting a robust strategy for the design of reconfigurable devices over a wide range of length scales.},

abstract = {We investigate the nonlinear dynamics of a periodic chain of bistable elements consisting of masses connected by elastic springs whose constraint arrangement gives rise to a large-deformation snap-through instability. We show that the resulting negative-stiffness effect produces three different regimes of (linear and nonlinear) wave propagation in the periodic medium, depending on the wave amplitude. At small amplitudes, linear elastic waves experience dispersion that is controllable by the geometry and by the level of precompression. At moderate to large amplitudes, solitary waves arise in the weakly and strongly nonlinear regime. For each case, we present closed-form analytical solutions and we confirm our theoretical findings by specific numerical examples. The precompression reveals a class of wave propagation for a partially positive and negative potential. The presented results highlight opportunities in the design of mechanical metamaterials based on negative-stiffness elements, which go beyond current concepts primarily based on linear elastic wave propagation. Our findings shed light on the rich effective dynamics achievable by nonlinear small-scale instabilities in solids and structures.},

abstract = {This paper is concerned with spatial linkages forming a closed loop. In one extreme configura-tion (deployed), these linkages form a frame of polygonal shape, such as a square or a hexagon, and in the other extreme (folded) configuration form a tight bundle. Throughout their motion range, they have mobility one. These linkages have potential applications for next-generation deployable spacecraft structures. The paper presents a systematic study of the kinematics of closed-loop structures with these special properties, and presents a numerical scheme for simu-lating their deployment without making any assumptions about particular symmetry features. The proposed simulation technique is applied to three examples that show different behaviour during deployment.},

Pentamodes also enable to implement three-dimensional transformation elastodynamics—the analogue of transformation optics. However, pentamodes have not been realized experimentally. Here, we investigate inasmuch the pentamode theoretical ideal suggested by Milton and Cherkaev in 1995 can be approximated by a metamaterial with current state-of-the-art lithography. Using numerical calculations calibrated by our fabricated three-dimensional microstructures, we find that the figure of merit, i.e., the ratio of bulk modulus to shear modulus, can realistically be made as large as about 1000.},

abstract = {Transforming flat sheets into three-dimensional structures has emerged as an exciting manufacturing paradigm on a broad range of length scales. Among other advantages, this technique permits the use of functionality-inducing planar processes on flat starting materials, which after shape-shifting, result in a unique combination of macro-scale geometry and surface topography. Fabricating arbitrarily complex three-dimensional geometries requires the ability to change the intrinsic curvature of initially flat structures, while simultaneously limiting material distortion to not disturb the surface features. The centuries-old art forms of origami and kirigami could offer elegant solutions, involving only folding and cutting to transform flat papers into complex geometries. Although such techniques are limited by an inherent developability constraint, the rational design of the crease and cut patterns enables the shape-shifting of (nearly) inextensible sheets into geometries with apparent intrinsic curvature. Here, we review recent origami and kirigami techniques that can be used for this purpose, discuss their underlying mechanisms, and create physical models to demonstrate and compare their feasibility. Moreover, we highlight practical aspects that are relevant in the development of advanced materials with these techniques. Finally, we provide an outlook on future applications that could benefit from origami and kirigami to create intrinsically curved surfaces.},

@article{Correa2015,
abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to study the behavior of negative stiffness beams when arranged in a honeycomb configuration and to compare the energy absorption capacity of these negative stiffness honeycombs with regular honeycombs of equivalent relative densities. Design/methodology/approach – A negative stiffness honeycomb is fabricated in nylon 11 using selective laser sintering. Its force-displacement behavior is simulated with finite element analysis and experimentally evaluated under quasi-static displacement loading. Similarly, a hexagonal honeycomb of equivalent relative density is also fabricated and tested. The energy absorbed for both specimens is computed from the resulting force-displacement curves. The beam geometry of the negative stiffness honeycomb is optimized for maximum energy absorption per unit mass of material. Findings – Negative stiffness honeycombs exhibit relatively large positive stiffness, followed by a region of plateau stress as the cell walls buckle, similar to regular hexagonal honeycombs, but unlike regular honeycombs, they demonstrate full recovery after compression. Representative specimens are found to absorb about 65 per cent of the energy incident on them. Optimizing the negative stiffness beam geometry can result in energy-absorbing capacities comparable to regular honeycombs of similar relative densities. Research limitations/implications – The honeycombs were subject to quasi-static displacement loading. To study shock isolation under impact loads, force-controlled loading is desirable. However, the energy absorption performance of the negative stiffness honeycombs is expected to improve under force-controlled conditions. Additional experimentation is needed to investigate the rate sensitivity of the force-displacement behavior of the negative stiffness honeycombs, and specimens with various geometries should be investigated. Originality/value – The findings of this study indicate that recoverable energy absorption is possible using negative stiffness honeycombs without sacrificing the high energy-absorbing capacity of regular honeycombs. The honeycombs can find usefulness in a number of unique applications requiring recoverable shock isolation, such as bumpers, helmets and other personal protection devices. A patent application has been filed for the negative stiffness honeycomb design.},

Here, through a combined numerical and experimental approach, we demonstrate that 2D auxetic materials with isotropic response can be easily realized by perforating a sheet with elongated cuts arranged to form a periodic pattern with either six-fold or three-fold symmetry. Moreover, we also show that the auxetic behavior can be easily tuned by varying the length of the cuts and that it is retained even under large levels of applied deformation beyond the limit of small strains. This novel, simple and scalable design can serve as an important guideline for designing and fabricating isotropic auxetic materials that can have a significant impact on a wide range of applications.},

Several Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and robotics researchers have started designing, prototyping and evaluating shape-changing devices, realising, however, that this vision still requires many engineering challenges to be addressed. On the material science front, we need break-throughs in stable and accessible materials to create novel, proof-of-concept devices. On the interactive devices side, we require a deeper appreciation for the material properties and an understanding of how exploiting material properties can provide affordances that unleash the human interactive potential. While these challenges are interesting for the re-spective research fields, we believe that the true power of shape-changing devices can be magnified by bringing together these communities. In this paper we therefore present a review of advances made in shape-changing materials and discuss their applications within an HCI context.},

By integrating three physical phenomena, including the bilayer bending actuation, the shape memory effect of the thermoplastic and the current-driven joule heating via conductive printing filament, we developed the actuator by simply printing a single layer conductive Polylactide (PLA) on a piece of copy paper via a desktop fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printer. This paper describes the fabrication process, the material mechanism, and the transformation primitives, followed by the electronic sensing and control methods. A software tool that assists the design, simulation and printing toolpath generation is introduced.

Solving this problem using classic iterative methods (e.g., Newton-Raphson methods), however, often suffers from slow convergence toward a desired solution. In this paper, we propose an asymptotic numerical method that exploits the underlying mathematical structure of specific nonlinear material models, and thus runs orders of magnitude faster than traditional Newton-type methods. We apply this method to compute rest shapes for elastic fabrication, where the rest shape of an elastic object is computed such that after physical fabrication the real object deforms into a desired shape.

Of particular interest is the relationship between the network topology or geometry and the specific motions observed under controlling perturbations. Here we study this relationship in mechanical networks of 2-D and 3-D Maxwell frames composed of point masses connected by rigid rods rotating freely about the masses. Through the study of bipartite graphs, we first develop basic principles that yield a simplified and intuitive understanding of all bipartite networks that give rise to an arbitrarily specified zero mode. We then extend these principles to characterize network topologies and geometries that simultaneously yield multiple zero modes, and to create large networks by coupling individual modules. These simple principles can be used to characterize and design networks with useful material (negative Poisson ratio) and mechanical (targeted allosteric response) properties.},

abstract = {Recent advances in three dimensional (3D) printing technology that allow multiple materials to be printed within each layer enable the creation of materials and components with precisely controlled heterogeneous microstructures. In addition, active materials, such as shape memory polymers, can be printed to create an active microstructure within a solid. These active materials can subsequently be activated in a controlled manner to change the shape or configuration of the solid in response to an environmental stimulus. This has been termed 4D printing, with the 4th dimension being the time-dependent shape change after the printing. In this paper, we advance the 4D printing concept to the design and fabrication of active origami, where a flat sheet automatically folds into a complicated 3D component. Here we print active composites with shape memory polymer fibers precisely printed in an elastomeric matrix and use them as intelligent active hinges to enable origami folding patterns. We develop a theoretical model to provide guidance in selecting design parameters such as fiber dimensions, hinge length, and programming strains and temperature. Using the model, we design and fabricate several active origami components that assemble from flat polymer sheets, including a box, a pyramid, and two origami airplanes. In addition, we directly print a 3D box with active composite hinges and program it to assume a temporary flat shape that subsequently recovers to the 3D box shape on demand.},

abstract = {Additive fabrication technologies are limited by the types of material they can print: while the technologies are continuously improving, still only a relatively small discrete set of materials can be used in each printed object. At the same time, the low cost of introducing geometric complexity suggests the alternative of controlling the elastic material properties by producing microstructures, which can achieve behaviors significantly differing from the solid printing material. While promising results have been obtained in this direction, fragility is a significant problem blocking practical applications, especially for achieving soft material properties: due to stress concentrations at thin joints, deformations and repeated loadings are likely to cause fracture. We present a set of methods to minimize stress concentrations in mi-crostructures by evolving their shapes. First, we demonstrate that the worst-case stress analysis problem (maximizing a stress measure over all possible unit loads) has an exact solution for periodic microstructures. We develop a new, accurate discretization of the shape derivative for stress objectives and introduce a low-dimensional parametric shape model for microstructures. This model supports robust minimization of maximal stress (approximated by an L p norm with high p) and an efficient implementation of printability constraints. In addition to significantly reducing stresses (by a typical factor of 5×), the new method substantially expands the range of effective material properties covered by the collection of structures.},

abstract = {Current interactive fabrication tools offer tangible feedback by allowing users to work directly on the physical model, but they are slow because users need to participate in the physical instantiation of their designs. In contrast, CAD software offers powerful tools for 3D modeling but delays access to the physical workpiece until the end of the design process. In this paper we propose On-the-Fly Print: a 3D modeling approach that allows the user to design 3D models digitally while having a low-fidelity physical wireframe model printed in parallel. Our software starts printing features as soon as they are created and updates the physical model as needed. Users can quickly check the design in a real usage context by removing the partial physical print from the printer and replacing it afterwards to continue printing. Digital content modification can be updated with quick physical correction using a retractable cutting blade. We present the detailed description of On-the-Fly Print and showcase several examples designed and printed with our system.},

Our combined analytical, experimental and numerical results indicate that under uniaxial tension the ligaments buckle out of plane, inducing the formation of 3D patterns whose morphology is controlled by the load direction. We also find that by largely stretching the buckled perforated sheets, plastic strains develop in the ligaments. This gives rise to the formation of kirigami sheets comprising periodic distribution of cuts and permanent folds. As such, the proposed buckling-induced pop-up strategy points to a simple route for manufacturing complex morphable structures out of flat perforated sheets.},

We have measured dynamic quantities during human actuation of a switch. We present a graphical representation technique called the "haptic profile" which emphasizes aspects of the feel of a switch as it is actuated, while minimizing the variability due to human actuation. When designing new switches, it is important to have the ability to specify, measure, and then verify the haptic properties of a switch. In order to do so, quantitative measures are required; qualitative descriptors of the haptic experience are insufficient. In this paper, we discuss the motivation and an apparatus for collecting the necessary haptic data.},

Each stable configuration of the unit cell corresponds to a stable phase, and transitions between these phases are regarded as phase transformations of the cellular material. We present a cellular material that exhibits phase transformation, identify key elements of the unit cell geometry that yield its mechanical behavior and introduce an analytical model that describes its constitutive behavior. Cellular materials that exhibit phase transformations show hysteresis and their response is characterized by a long serrated loading and unloading plateaus, making these materials attractive for energy absorption applications. While these phase transforming cellular materials offer an energy absorption performance that is comparable to metal and polymeric honeycombs, the key difference is that the deformation on these materials is fully recoverable.},

As we demonstrate with a diverse set of examples ranging from a spatial wing (left) and steering mechanism (middle) to a compliant hand well-suited for teleoperation tasks (right), our technique leads to structurally-sound and function-preserving compliant designs. We present a computational tool for designing compliant mechanisms. Our method takes as input a conventional, rigidly-articulated mechanism defin-ing the topology of the compliant design. This input can be both planar or spatial, and we support a number of common joint types which, whenever possible, are automatically replaced with parameterized flexures. As the technical core of our approach, we describe a number of objectives that shape the design space in a meaningful way, including trajectory matching, collision avoidance, lateral stability, resilience to failure, and minimizing motor torque. Optimal designs in this space are obtained as solutions to an equilibrium-constrained minimization problem that we solve using a variant of sensitivity analysis. We demonstrate our method on a set of examples that range from simple four-bar linkages to full-fledged animatronics, and verify the feasibility of our designs by manufacturing physical prototypes.},

Yet, rapid prototyping both the form and function of these custom objects can be problematic, particularly for those with limited electronics or programming experience. Designers often need to embed custom circuitry; program its workings; and create a form factor that not only reflects the desired user experience but can also house the required circuitry and electronics. To mitigate this, we created Pineal, a design tool that lets end-users: (1) modify 3D models to include a smart watch or phone as its heart; (2) specify high-level interactive behaviours through visual programming; and (3) have the phone or watch act out such behaviours as the objects' "smarts". Furthermore, a series of prototypes show how Pineal exploits mobile sensing and output, and automatically generates 3D printed form-factors for rich, interactive, objects.},

abstract = {This review summarizes progress toward programming two-dimensional (2D) polymer sheets which respond to a variety of external stimuli to form three-dimensional (3D) shapes or topographical features on macroscopically planar sheets. Shape programming strategically adds value or function to 2D sheets, films, or coatings that can be created inexpensively. 2D substrates are common form factors that are compatible with ordinary 2D patterning techniques (i.e., inkjet, photolithography, roll-to-roll printing) and may be stored, packed, and shipped efficiently. Polymer materials are attractive due to their flexibility, light weight, low price, and compatibility with high throughput processing. This review highlights strategies for triggering shape change in planar polymeric materials. The strategies are divided into four broad categories: (1) 2D substrates with latent topography "programmed" using conventional microfabrication, (2) 2D substrates that form topography due to imposed or self-generated stress, (3) 2D substrates that form 3D shapes by out-of-plane bending, and (4) 2D substrates that use "hinges" to achieve out-of-plane folding. The review highlights all strategies while focusing primarily on last two approaches.},

Our system supports several modeling operations, including the operation to construct a 3D polygonal surface from a 2D silhouette drawn by the user: it inflates the region surrounded by the silhouette making wide areas fat, and narrow areas thin. Teddy, our prototype system, is implemented as a Java™ program, and the mesh construction is done in real-time on a standard PC. Our informal user study showed that a first-time user typically masters the operations within 10 minutes, and can construct interesting 3D models within minutes.},

abstract = {A new class of soft composite materials with dynamically tunable and reversible surface topographies is introduced that allows a wide diversity and local positioning of surface features. The particle-enhanced soft composites are comprised of a soft elastomeric matrix with relatively stiff particles embedded below the surface. Upon application of external stimuli, a surface that is originally smooth and flat (or of other initial topology) transforms to engineered surface topographies. Finite element based micromechanical simulations are used to design and study the hybrid material structures that govern the evolution in surface topographies. Physical prototypes are fabricated using multimaterial 3D-printing, and then experimentally evaluated to validate the accuracy of our simulations. It is demonstrated that a rich variety in periodic and random surface features including variable waves, crease-like features, flat apexes, and valleys can be attained by changing different dimensionless geometric parameters (e.g., relative particle size, shapes, spacing, and distributions). Furthermore, these surface features can be locally controlled by positioning of particles and do not rely on instabilities. The material design depends primarily on the geometry of the particles and the arrays, making this approach to on-demand custom and reversible surface patterning applicable over a wide range of size scales. Creating tunable and reversible surfaces is an interesting challenge with no single solution. A new approach using a composite of stiff particles embedded into a soft matrix provides a wide range of tunable and locally controllable surface topographies. By applying an external load to the composite, complex surface topographies take shape.},

abstract = {Virtually all executives today recognize the need to provide outstanding service to customers. Focusing on the customer, however, is both an imperative and a potential curse. In their desire to become customer driven, many companies have resorted to inventing new programs and procedures to meet every customer's request. But as customers and their needs grow increasingly diverse, such an approach has become a surefire way to add unnecessary cost and complexity to operations. Companies around the world have embraced mass customization in an attempt to avoid those pitfalls. Readily available information technology and flexible work processes permit them to customize goods or services for individual customers in high volumes at low cost. But many managers have discovered that mass customization itself can produce unnecessary cost and complexity. They are realizing that they did not examine thoroughly enough what kind of customization their customers would value before they plunged ahead. That is understandable. Until now, no framework has existed to help managers determine the type of customization they should pursue. James Gilmore and Joseph Pine provide managers with just such a framework. They have identified four distinct approaches to customization. When designing or redesigning a product, process, or business unit, managers should examine each approach for possible insights into how to serve their customers best. In some cases, a single approach will dominate the design. More often, however, managers will need a mix of some or all of the four approaches to serve their own particular set of customers.},

abstract = {3D printing hardware is rapidly scaling up to output continuous mixtures of multiple materials at increasing resolution over ever larger print volumes. This poses an enormous computational chal- lenge: large high-resolution prints comprise trillions of voxels and petabytes of data and simply modeling and describing the input with spatially varying material mixtures at this scale is challeng- ing. Existing 3D printing software is insufficient; in particular, most software is designed to support only a few million primitives, with discrete material choices per object. We present OpenFab, a programmable pipeline for synthesis of multi-material 3D printed objects that is inspired by RenderMan and modern GPU pipelines. The pipeline supports procedural evaluation of geometric detail and material composition, using shader-like fablets, allowing models to be specified easily and efficiently. We describe a streaming archi- tecture for OpenFab; only a small fraction of the final volume is stored in memory and output is fed to the printer with little startup delay. We demonstrate it on a variety of multi-material objects. CR},

The simulation results show that ultralight metamaterial plates with textured stubs deposited on the surface can support strong local resonances for both symmetric and anti-symmetric modes at low frequencies, where Lamb waves at the resonance frequencies are highly localized in the vibrating stubs. The resonance frequency is very sensitive to the geometry of textured stubs. By reasonable design of the geometry of resonant elements, we establish a simple loaded-bar model with the array of oscillators having a gradient relative density (or weight) that can support multiple local resonances, which permits the feasibility of a broadband Lamb wave trapping. Our study could be potentially significant in designing ingenious weight-efficient acoustic devices for practical applications, such as shock absorption, cushioning, and vibrations traffic, etc.},

abstract = {Hierarchically designed structures with architectural features that span across multiple length scales are found in numerous hard biomaterials, like bone, wood, and glass sponge skeletons, as well as manmade structures, like the Eiffel Tower. It has been hypothesized that their mechanical robustness and damage tolerance stem from sophisticated ordering within the constituents, but the specific role of hierarchy remains to be fully described and understood. We apply the principles of hierarchical design to create structural metamaterials from three material systems: (i) polymer, (ii) hollow ceramic, and (iii) ceramic-polymer composites that are patterned into self-similar unit cells in a fractal-like geometry. In situ nanomechanical experiments revealed (i) a nearly theoretical scaling of structural strength and stiffness with relative density, which outperforms existing nonhierarchical nanolattices; (ii) recoverability, with hollow alumina samples recovering up to 98{\%} of their original height after compression to ≥50{\%} strain; (iii) suppression of brittle failure and structural instabilities in hollow ceramic hierarchical nanolattices; and (iv) a range of deformation mechanisms that can be tuned by changing the slenderness ratios of the beams. Additional levels of hierarchy beyond a second order did not increase the strength or stiffness, which suggests the existence of an optimal degree of hierarchy to amplify resilience. We developed a computational model that captures local stress distributions within the nanolattices under compression and explains some of the underlying deformation mechanisms as well as validates the measured effective stiffness to be interpreted as a metamaterial property.},

abstract = {Multi-material 3D printing allows objects to be composed of com- plex, heterogeneous arrangements of materials. It is often more nat- ural to define a functional goal than to define the material composi- tion of an object. Translating these functional requirements to fabri- cable 3D prints is still an open research problem. Recently, several specific instances of this problem have been explored (e.g., appear- ance or elastic deformation), but they exist as isolated, monolithic algorithms. In this paper, we propose an abstraction mechanism that simplifies the design, development, implementation, and reuse of these algorithms. Our solution relies on two new data structures: a reducer tree that efficiently parameterizes the space of material assignments and a tuner network that describes the optimization process used to compute material arrangement. We provide an ap- plication programming interface for specifying the desired object and for defining parameters for the reducer tree and tuner network. We illustrate the utility of our framework by implementing several fabrication algorithms as well as demonstrating the manufactured results.},

We present the results of an extensive Delphi survey on the future of additive manufacturing with a focus on its economic and societal implications in 2030. Via an initial round of extensive qualitative interviews and a Delphi-based analysis of 3510 quantitative estimations and 1172 qualitative comments from 65 experts, we were able to develop and validate 18 projections that were then clustered into a scenario for the most probable future. The scenario is built on the six Delphi projections with the highest consensus on the likelihood of occurrence. We complement this most probable scenario with a discussion on controversial, extreme scenarios. Based on these findings we derive implications for industry, policy, and future research.},

This printer allows the substantial advantages of additive manufacturing techniques (including rapid turn-around prototyping of physical objects and support for high levels of customization and configuration) to be employed with a new class of material. This material is a form of loose felt formed when fibers from an incoming feed of yarn are entangled with the fibers in layers below it. The resulting objects recreate the geometric forms specified in the solid models which specify them, but are soft and flexible -- somewhat reminiscent in character to hand knitted materials. This extends 3D printing from typically hard and precise forms into a new set of forms which embody a different aesthetic of soft and imprecise objects, and provides a new capability for researchers to explore the use of this class of materials in interactive devices.},

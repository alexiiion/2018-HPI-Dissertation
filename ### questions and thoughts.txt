Oliver:
1. what is your contribution to HCI?
2. what is your contribution to Metamaterials?

(HCI: using the concept of metamaterials allwos to create interactive objects with no electronics (& printed in one piece))
(mm: metamaterials viewed in isolation, we integrate in objects and build tools to do so -> need system to mix & match mm cells, oliver thought of analogy to systems engineering)

Interactive metamaterials build cool bridge to jaws that allows a "metamaterial object" to contain other things.
